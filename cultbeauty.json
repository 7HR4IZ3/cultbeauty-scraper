        "description": "Not content with keeping our lips, lashes, lids and cheeks looking flawless, Huda Beauty has unveiled the secret to perfectly baked make up looks: Easy Bake Loose Powder. Supremely smooth, silky and ultra-finely milled, this sublime powder blends seamlessly into skin leaving a soft, velvety matte finish with a hint of sheen thats a million miles from cakey, drying powders. Blessed with a beautiful, petal-esque perfume, its perfect for baking, setting make up in place all day long, blurring the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and controlling shine throughout the day  all without creating a white cast or causing flashback in photographs. Paraben-free, non-comedogenic and enriched with protective vitamin E, the easy-to-use loose powder leaves a beautiful airbrushed finish, subtly colour correcting and highlighting and leaving a translucent veil of colour on your skin  so you can bake without the cake! To suit your skin tone, there are eight sweet treat-inspired shades to choose from, including Cupcake, Banana Bread, Cinnamon Bun and Coffee Cake, alongside neutral 'Sugar Cookie'  so grab your brush or blender and get ready to bake!*A bit baffled by baking? Hudas ingenious Insta Glossary describes it as applying a thick coat of translucent powder over your foundation in areas you want to look the brightest (often underneath eyes, along your jawline and down the centre of your nose) letting it sit for 3-5 minutes then dusting it off with a clean, fluffy brush.",

It’s loaded with ten precious extracts including papaya and vitamin C to protect, brighten and revitalise skin — all with a dreamy, champagne-gold gleam. Use it under your make up for lit-from-within radiance, apply it as a highlight, or you can wear it on top of your favourite foundation for maximum impact. It feels like nothing, but looks like everything.",

Ergonomically designed for easy handling, the Facial Razor is easy to wield, clean, and store — with each blade (it comes with three spare) fitting into the provided safety cap. Utterly sanitary, the blades are forged with stainless steel, which you can simply rinse with warm water or swipe with an alcohol wipe after use. ",

Then there's mulberry leaf to help minimize hyperpigmentation and dark spots over time and boost the skin's clarity and radiance. The light-reflecting pigments also revive dull skin without leaving a sparkly or glittery finish. Top tip: slather it over your face, chest, legs, or anywhere else you want a touch of luminosity.

These give such a lovely glow when mixed in with moisturiser or sunscreen, or add a bit of glow on the high points of your face as a highlight on their own.

Red LED light works to stimulate collagen production deep within the skin, (which reduces the look of fine lines, sun damage and redness) and provides anti-inflammatory support to relieve muscle and joint pain. Blue LED light then destroys blemish-causing bacteria to prevent future breakouts and give you visible results. With this, you can expect to see a reduction in blemishes and fine lines in a matter of mere weeks…",

            "My daughter asked for this for Xmas and she is delighted with it, especially to treat acne on her neck and chest",
            "I was amazed by how good this is a relieving pains, I use it on my shoulder, back of the neck on the 14 min setting and on my neck, abdomen and feet on the 3 min setting for skin rejuvenation.",
            "I have had great results for my acne in my decollate, it is practically gone since I am using this. I got it on offer so that was great too.",
            "I am 43 with spot-prone skin and I knew I had to find another way to tackle this issue. I'd always wanted to try light therapy but it's expensive, so when this was on offer I thought it was the perfect opportunity to try. It had gotten to the point where the painful, cyst-like breakouts on my chin and neck were really getting me down and I had tried everything to get rid of them. Within a couple of days of using this, the spots were fading, and within a week they were gone. I use this pretty much daily and they haven't. come. back...I could honestly cry with happiness at the results. I use the combo setting to tackle acne and ageing...I've not seen much of a difference yet on the ageing side of things, but I'm not putting this down any time soon! Thanks Dr Dennis! x",
            "I have some acne and gastroparesis, as well as chronic pain. I decided the acne healing and the possibility of some myofascial release was enough to buy when this item was on offer at 50%. \n\n                            The acne is better, though not gone. The muscle surface release has helped my gastroparesis difficulties. I haven't realised how much stress is being held in my abdominal region. \n\n                            I'm fairly impressed. I am however unhappy that this like most beauty electronics appears to be non-repairable if anything goes wrong. Environmentally, we require the right to repair and recycle effectively.

        "description": "Ask any beauty buff to name their favourite concealers and, chances are, the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer will top the list.  Coveted by anyone whos heard of it (from professional make up artists and beauty editors to make up junkies everywhere) for its luxurious texture and luminous finish, this dreamy concealer evens skin out with lightweight, medium-to-high buildable coverage. Leaving cakey, crease-prone formulas behind, this one is enriched with hydrating, multi-action skin care benefits and light-diffusing technology, creating a softer, smoother complexion while instantly obscuring imperfections and diminishing fine lines and signs of fatigue. Whether youre camouflaging dark circles, battling blemishes, hiding stubborn spots or simply evening out your skin tone, this long-wearing, crease-proof formula is the perfect option and it comes in 30 versatile shades (were hardly surprised that its the number one-selling concealer in the U.S.). ",

            "A regular repurchase for me. Staying power and doesn’t wrinkle into my skin.",
            "This is the perfect mix of coverage and perfect blending seamlessly into the skin for me. Never looks too heavy but covers everything. Really good range of shades for me too. Have repurchased numerous times and can't see this changing any time soon!",
            "This is great, sits beautifully on skin and doesnt crease so long as you blend in properly",
            "I love it!! Amazing product at a perfect price\n                            Highly recommended!!",
            "This is the “it girl” concealer! it is so light weight and has a skin like finish. I absolutely adore this concealer and will forever be purchasing it x",
            "I ordered it because of the hype on TikTok. The shade match is really really good however it’s a bit patchy and feels kind of on the heavier side on the eye.. maybe I should try to blend it as soon as I apply it and not let it sit.",
            "This goes on so smooth and doesn’t crease blends in easily",
            "I've used a couple of times but it's definitely not become a staple part of my make up routine. But that could be down to it not blending great with my favourite foundation",
            "I will always come back to this concealer - good coverage and not too drying under the eye",
            "does not oxidize. smooth application and covers under eye circles. great product!"

        "description": "It only takes having a shower in a different part of the country to notice just how much of an effect water has on your skin and strands. That's why the minds behind HELLO KLEAN created their fan-favourite Shower Filter...  Though hard water is just freshwater infused with minerals that offer health benefits, those same minerals - like calcium, magnesium, iron, nickel and copper - can prevent the surfactants in your shampoo from lathering, and contribute to buildup. Effectively capturing those minerals that can dry your skin and give way to soap scum, as well as filtering bacteria, impurities and chlorine, this screw-on filter (don't be deterred, it's super easy to fit) effectively improves the quality of the water flowing over you so you can enjoy smoother, softer skin and hair. How does it work? The sleek tool has stainless mesh to capture sand and other sediments; calcium sulfite to remove chlorine; KDF 55 to target minerals and residual chlorine; granular activated carbon to remove bacteria, mould and odours; finally, ceramic beads help to balance your shower water's pH level. We've never been more ready to dive in the shower... ",
        "reviews": [
            "Have been using for 2 weeks now. Definitely can see changes in hair fall and less itch on my dry skin. Will repurchase more for other bathrooms.",
            "Soothing for my psoriasis skin.  Can feel a difference.",
            "Love this filter so much. Haven’t used for ages as have been cost cutting but bought again recently & remembered what a difference it makes. I live in a hard water area (Reading) & this absolutely softens the water-  can really feel the difference in my hair.",
            "I live in the South east where there’s a lot of chalk in the water and I really struggle with limescale showing up on my shower so I bought this hoping it would help with my hair and skin as well. My shower needs way less regular cleaning of the glass and my hair actually feels clean all the way through rather than feeling like I have shampoo build up. So far I’m really enjoying this and I’ve already bought a refill, it was also so easy to install.",
            "I didn’t think this would make much difference to my shower but it really hard. Skin feels softer and cleaner",
            "I havent been using it for a long time, but my hair and skin definitely looks better, softer and shinnier.",
            "We live in an area with very hard water where there are water marks all over the shower after every use. I bought this in the hope that it would help my blonde hair and stop it from getting so brassy and dull. I can safely say I’m already noticing a difference both with my hair and the actual shower! Can’t wait to see the long term results",
            "I seldom write a review, but this product is REALLY good! I have been experiencing hair loss since moving to a new city with extreme hard water, tried numerous shampoo and none of them worked. I saw the review of this product and was doubtful of its effect, but I was like, why not? I have tried so many shampoos anyway.\n\n                            The effect was immediate even after my first day of shower. Hair is much softer now, and the most important thing is, I don’t lose hair as many as like after having a hair cut. Highly recommended if you live in city with hard water.",
            "Have really noticed a difference in my hair since using + easy to install. Just bought refill approx 5 months later.",
            "Been a great solution and use for growing my hair out. I have noticed my hair is softer and cleaner for longer. Has made the shower head pretty heavy but that is just an aspect of this type of product"

The antibacterial properties of mandarin and rosemary extracts help to cleanse, while lavender assists skin in feeling soothed and hydrated. It's brilliant for people who like to wash their hands a lot or who have sensitive skins. As you wash your hands, it makes your bathroom or kitchen smell divine. Aesop don’t believe in ‘anti’ – you won’t see any hyperbolic ‘anti-ageing’ or ‘anti-acne’ claims – instead, their products are developed to complement a balanced lifestyle, and help protect against the elements. This is ‘pro’ skin care for those who’re planning to grow older gracefully, proud of the skin that they live in.",

        "description": "Accents of Brazilian jasmine, fresh ocean air and a light touch of ‘Tropicália Vanilla’, the Brazilian Crush Cheirosa ‘68 Beija Flor Perfume Mist encapsulates the colourful energy of Brazil in the creative year of 1968… a homage to the Tropicalia Movement of this time. Utterly effusive yet unexpected, this floral-scented mist will transport you to the sun-dappled lands of Rio’s vibrant shores. With each and every spritz of this immersive vanilla fragrance you’ll journey through top notes of lychee essence and pink dragonfruit, through salty ocean air notes and fresh blooms of hibiscus down to a sheer vanilla and sun musk base. Sustainably sourced and perfectly mirroring the colourful energy of Brazil’s Tropicalia Movement, you’ll be left so ‘cheirosa’ — if you were wondering, that means ‘you smell incredibly delicious and irresistible’ by the way. Available in a 240ml full-size and 90ml on-the-go mini, you need never leave this fruity floral scent behind. ",

Used on dry skin before bathing, this miraculous mitt is made from an innovative fabric weave that is gentler than a synthetic or natural loofah, yet effective enough to sweep away dead skin cells to reveal softer, smoother, healthier-looking skin. Perfect for kick-starting the exfoliation process, the mitt allows subsequent products to work more effectively and helps to unblock hair follicles to minimise pesky, uncomfortable ingrown hairs. It’s also brilliant for treating Keratosis Pilaris – a remarkably common condition which causes skin to appear rough, red and bumpy due to an excess production of keratin, which results in the development of little ‘plugs’ or goose bumps. Use it on dry skin and prepare to witness the transformation…",

        "description": "There's a reason why experts and health authorities across the world recommend Elvie to women with pelvic floor problems - it's a hi-tech, comfortable and results-driven device that ensures women make the most of their pelvic floor exercises. Plenty of factors can weaken the pelvic floor muscles, including pregnancy, childbirth, ageing and high-impact sport, to the point that 1 in 3 women experience issues with them - and up to 80% of expectant mums. Designed to strengthen these muscles, the trainer can help to improve bladder control and sex, as well as preparing for childbirth and speeding up postnatal recovery. How does it work? The bulb of the tracker features force and motion sensors to measure the movement of your muscles as they contract and release. This is inserted into the vagina with the tail remaining outside and facing forwards (a little like a tampon), then via Bluetooth it connects to an app on your phone that will guide you through a series of five-minute workouts - from target hitting to strength exercises. There are four different levels to try - Training, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced - all of which have been carefully designed with the help of physiotherapists and experts. The app also allows you to track your progress, set yourself targets and schedule reminders - plus it's fun, so it'll help you to stay motivated! Incredibly discreet, the device comes in a sleek carry case that doubles up as a charger so you can pop it in your on-the-go bag for use anytime, anywhere. 100% waterproof, the trainer is made with medical grade silicone making it incredibly durable and safe.",
        "reviews": [
            "The app for this is so great - lots of variety and you can really see your progress which is motivating. Also easy to clean.",
            "i honestly dont know why society cant hand these out for free for every female out there. pelvic floors are so important and it almost seems like a taboo topic. the exercises are challenging but great. the insertion can be a little tricky and may require some time to get used to. but it is an incredible product and it deserves a lot of praise. the women who came up with this deserve an award. i would strongly recommend this to anyone.",
            "Bought this at around 16 weeks pregnant to make sure my pelvic floor was in as good a condition as possible early on. Have found it incredibly useful to see visually that I’m doing exercises correctly. Noticeable difference and improvement with the exercises within a few weeks. Have been using it maybe 4x a week since August and only needed to charge 3-4 times. You can set targets for how often to practice using the app and it reminds you. You can see the battery life when you open the app and it will warn you to charge if there isn’t enough to complete the exercises. Not had any problems with connecting to my phone. Very easy to clean. Stores away discreetly in its case. So glad I decided to go for it as I was a bit hesitant due to price. Have avoided any problems with continence throughout my whole pregnancy and I believe this has helped a lot. Would definitely recommend - there’s clearly a reason some patients get these on the NHS!",
            "Haven't stopped recommending Elvie since I bought it!  Its made a huge difference to my pelvic floor which was pretty shot after having twins and I was getting a bit tired of peeing myself when I sneezed or laughed!  Regular practice with Elvie and that is a thing of the past.  I've not had a problem at all with the battery life but it can be a bit temperamental connecting when I've changed phones / upgraded but their customer service is very helpful.",
            "As a pregnant woman who started having some issues I thought I'm not waiting until after the baby comes, I'm handling this now already. I hesitated a long time seeing the price but the fact that there's an app reminding me to do it, and that I can see if I'm doing it correctly, as well as if there's progress made etc., has made it all worthwhile. I do already see the difference. \n                             I have not had any issues with connecting nor with the battery but I always wonder if it's charged or not as indeed there are no indicators.",
            "I am the exact demographic this product is aimed at. I’ve had 5 babies! The fact that I can not get the Elvie to work when inserted properly is a sad start. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions and still can’t get it going. To say I was desperate for this to work is an understatement. My disappointment now equals that desperation.",
            "This works great for its purpose, but the battery is good for a couple of days, a week maybe. And after a year of using the trainer I have a problem with connecting the device to my phone - if it is not used a couple of days it needs to be charged for a bit, otherwise, it never connects. This is annoying.",
            "I love the workout and the way it progressively gives you harder and harder exercises to do. Within one week I found a noticeable difference in pelvic floor strength. However, the battery is good for only one week. This would be a five-star product for me if there were a battery life indicator.",
            "Have tried this product and it has taken some time to to get used to using. I am progressing slowly but l am pleased with the progress I am achieving. I thought it was expensive but if it works for you, that’s good. The app is easy to use and it’s nice to know whether you are doing the exercises correctly. I am pleased so far."

        "description": "Providing a deep clean that reaches even the most inaccessible parts of your mouth, this Sonic Toothbrush from Spotlight Oral Care boasts three settings - 'Sensitive', 'Clean' and 'White' - so you can target plaque and discolouration as you please.Equal parts gentle and effective in maintaining and promoting oral health, this efficient tool employs high-frequency brush movements to ensure that both toothpaste and oxygen are delivered to hard-to-reach nooks and crannies. It has clever 2-minute timer to ensure that you hit your brushing quota every time as well as an impressively long-lasting battery, so you won't need to fret if you forget to hook it up to the charger one night. As for the settings, you can choose between 'Sensitive' (31,000 reps/min) for gentle care, 'Clean' (41,000 reps/min) for your standard scrub and 'White' (48,000 reps/min) for intense surface stain removal. Get ready to brush up!",
        "reviews": [
            "It felt too light on the teeth and I felt a layer on my teeth which made me suspect that it wasn't cleaning well.  When I saw my dentist we found out that I had plaque on my teeth due to not cleaning well, which was never the case when I was using my Oral-b electric toothbrush.  So I've decided to go back to Oral-B instead.",
            "This is a great toothbrush. I never had an electric toothbrush before this one and wished I'd had one earlier. My dentist noticed a massive improvement on the condition of my gums and I normally need some kind of work and didn't for the first time after about 8 months of using this.",
            "I wore braces for around 5 years growing up so I'm a big believer in looking after your teeth. Floss, mouthwash I do the lot and I love it. Anything to keep my teeth/gums healthy and keep me out of that dentist chair then I will do it. I'd had the same toothbrush for years, it was good, did the job and I was happy. When Spotlight joined Cult Beauty and the reviews came in thick and fast I decided to buy this for myself and my husband. The product is light to hold, has three different settings and is more gentle than my previous toothbrush yet keeps my teeth squeaky clean. It's timed so you dedicate 30 seconds to each corner, so simple and definitely makes you think about how long you used to spend on brushing. I'm also using the toothpaste and the whitening strips as this brand just tick all the boxes - effective, created by dentist and sustainable (their toothpaste tubes are made out of sugar cane). Invest, you won't regret it!",
            "I cannot fault this device after only 1 month of use. It really gave me excellent results within the 1st couple of days and I'm so glad I'm now using this as my other (well known branded) electric toothbrush was coming to the end of its effective use. Well worth the investment if you want squeaky clean teeth and the help of prevention for further problems!",
            "I'm currently on acne medication which has affected me in all kinds of ways! Including my teeth. \n\n                            I noticed I had a build-up of plaque and sore gums on my back teeth. \n\n                            I cleaned my teeth with this and it really did clean my teeth, I couldn't believe my eyes when looking in the sink! It really does clean your teeth without irritating them. \n\n                            Would 10/10 recommend!",
            "I ordered myself one of these toothbrushes a couple of weeks ago and am so impressed that I am now ordering one for my daughter too.\n                            The whitening setting a excellent, I am using it with the same brand toothpaste and am definitely noticing results. \n                            I have had a few different electric toothbrushes over the years, but this is easily the best.\n                            I would definitely recommend this and other products from the range.",
            "I Absolutely love this oral care, bought it for myself and my partner as a valentines gift (really an excuse to but it for myself in all honesty) I also purchased the whitening strips which we love. I have had zoom teeth whitening but over 10 years ago, the whitening strips along with the sonic brush and toothpaste are working a treat and I can see a huge improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it. I also love the packaging, very well thought out and the handy carry case means I look after it and keep it clean and in a safe place. I have charges once in a month and that was about a week ago so I suspect the battery life is very very good!"

            "I have been waiting for so long for Hourglass to make a palette truly suitable for fair skin and they finally delivered. I can t express how much I love ALL the shades in this palette. The bronzer is finally suitable for fair skin, it is more neutral, not too warm like before. Hopefully in the future they will make a contour shade instead of a bronzer. The biggest surprise I must say was the highlighter. It is out of this world!! Much more glowy than the other highlighters from Hourglass and also far better in terms of texture than the Dior Backstage quad in my opinion.",
            "Beautiful selection of shades for pale skin! Beautiful natural glow from different products, must have Christmas gift for any pale skinned people.",
            "This palette is the perfect all-rounder for fair to light skin tones. I love every single shade and I am very happy with the inclusion of bronzer this year compared to last year's Butterfly. The blushes are also more cohesive for fair skin tones and are not overpowering. Sometimes they can be fairly similar, as the marbling varies and hence the tone might be slightly darker/lighter but hardly noticeable. The company says it is the same amount of each colour in every pan, but in my experience you get some variance with the marbling and the final colour. There is a usually noticeable difference between the two blushes tho, and the highlight shade is the prettiest ethereal light pink. 3 of these shades are new which is great, and there is also 2 finishing powders for somebody who likes to set and brighten their foundation/concealer or blend the rest of the colours/harsh lines together. Best palette for fair skin from Hourglass so far!",
            "This is my first ever purchase of Hourglass products, usually Charlotte Tilbury is my preferred brand. But I just couldn’t resist the idea of this palette: the beautiful design and all shades that are specifically suited for fair skins, which is rare in my view! I have a fair to light complexion with neutral undertone and find all powders fitting well. I use the bronzer and the highlighter as eye shadows too, so would need only one palette for travel.",
            "I will always buy hourglass pallets, I know they’re expensive but the formula is amazing! This jellyfish one is great for fair toned skin and has one of their most popular finishing powders",
            "I have never had an Hourglass palette before and now I’m completely hooked. I wasn’t sure if pink blush was for me as I’m quite an orange girl at heart the formula of these are so subtle and buildable that you can blend them easily with other blushes to make custom shades. It’s love at first swipe!",
            "This is perhaps not the most unique curation of colours that Hourglass has put out but it suits my skin tone perfectly (fair-light).  I am so glad they opted for a more neutral bronzer in this palette as the other variations looked a bit too warm for my cool complexion.  This product is great qualify but definitely overpriced!  Glad I could redeem some reward points toward the cost.",
            "I originally bought the leopard and the snake palettes as more suited for my olive tone skin. But wanted to try the jellyfish as I liked the blushes in this palette. Wow: surprise! surprise! The bronzer came out really nice and the combined blushes are beautiful. I liked using the powder to set under my eyes and it did not come out grey in the contrary. Overall, really pleased!",
            "Love love love this.. I have fair skin and these shades are perfect for me, I put my powder on as normal then use these products and my skin looks blurred. These pallets are expensive but definitely worth it."

(Show off those freckles!)  Fuelled with hydrating hyaluronic acid (a humectant that pulls moisture into skin) and a brightening blend of rose-derived ingredients, this formula not only instantly beautifies, but improves the look of skin over time too. The vegan and cruelty-free formula (Leaping Bunny-approved, no less) plumps, smooths and encourages radiance, while the perfecting medium coverage evens the look of skin. Plus, it comes in a recyclable tube and you can have your pick of 30 beautiful shades. ",

            "This is such an underrated foundation, my go to. Never fails!",
            "Great foundation, looks very natural and gives my skin a healthy glow, the only thing I would say is that it can highlight dryer skin around my nose which I don't love. But if i just avoid this area overall look is great.",
            "The finish is natural and beautiful but it doesn’t last for many hours. I also noticed that it caused me little bumps…",
            "A beautiful finish with this foundation, your skin still looks and feels like skin. I’ve used it on myself and on clients. I love it especially on older clients too. \n                            Good choice of colours and ideal with CT setting spray x",
            "I normally opt for more full coverage foundation but decided to try this out - it looks super natural on the skin, blends in really well and looks like your natural skin but better! Would definitely recommend this. Also feels hydrating and leaves skin looking healthy and glowy.",
            "I love CT but for some reason I don’t get on with her foundations. Airbrush settles in every line and this broke me out and slipped off my combo skin after a few hours.",
            "A good dewy foundation that lasts well on the skin. I’m quite oily and have found after 6ish hours this will start to move around on the skin.",
            "Light to medium coverage, moisturising and natural.",
            "love this foundation. i have oily skin and looks great through the day. not too heavy",
            "I own about 20 foundations, and this is by far my favourite. I often struggle to get my foundation to lay correctly on my skin and have to reapply like 4 times over to get it right. This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

            "I loved this blush but when I blended it with my brush, it was kinda patchy but when I blended it with my fingers it was ok, however I don't like touching my face when putting on makeup so this probably won't be the first blush I'll grab.",

This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

            "I normally opt for more full coverage foundation but decided to try this out - it looks super natural on the skin, blends in really well and looks like your natural skin but better! Would definitely recommend this. Also feels hydrating and leaves skin looking healthy and glowy.",
            "I love CT but for some reason I don’t get on with her foundations. Airbrush settles in every line and this broke me out and slipped off my combo skin after a few hours.",
            "A good dewy foundation that lasts well on the skin. I’m quite oily and have found after 6ish hours this will start to move around on the skin.",

This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

I think it’s really soft and creamy to apply and has fab coverage, but sometimes doesn’t work well with the procure i’ve applied on my face already. Must be due to the silicone in the formula - so potentially works much better with silicone based primers. Because after applying it after my spf, my under eyes looked dry and cakes and weird. which is odd cuz my spf is super glowy. so be careful before spending so much",

            "High coverage but needs setting with powder as it creases. I'm using it as a brightening concealer rather than a blemish covering as it's a bit too creamy for that imo. I set it with a powder puff and a loose powder. Will probably try another brand when it runs out.",
            "I’m never going back to too faced! This is the creamiest concealer and a little goes a long way! Only sort of complaint would be about the packaging itself, after a few uses it does start to leak!"

This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

I think it’s really soft and creamy to apply and has fab coverage, but sometimes doesn’t work well with the procure i’ve applied on my face already. Must be due to the silicone in the formula - so potentially works much better with silicone based primers. Because after applying it after my spf, my under eyes looked dry and cakes and weird. which is odd cuz my spf is super glowy. so be careful before spending so much",
            "If you want a high coverage concealer - look no further! Love this concealer! This isn't a dewy, very moisturising, no-make-up type of concealer. Don't use too much and you can achieve a beautiful flawless result that isn't drying on the undereyes. The shade range is great too.",
            "Good concealer. \n\n                            I am a avid make up buyer but always feel like concealers are much of a much-ness. It's good, doesn't crease, brightnening (if brought in the right shade).",
            "High coverage but needs setting with powder as it creases. I'm using it as a brightening concealer rather than a blemish covering as it's a bit too creamy for that imo. I set it with a powder puff and a loose powder. Will probably try another brand when it runs out.",
            "I’m never going back to too faced! This is the creamiest concealer and a little goes a long way! Only sort of complaint would be about the packaging itself, after a few uses it does start to leak!"

Fuelled with hydrating hyaluronic acid (a humectant that pulls moisture into skin) and a brightening blend of rose-derived ingredients, this formula not only instantly beautifies, but improves the look of skin over time too. The vegan and cruelty-free formula (Leaping Bunny-approved, no less) plumps, smooths and encourages radiance, while the perfecting medium coverage evens the look of skin. Plus, it comes in a recyclable tube and you can have your pick of 30 beautiful shades. ",

This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund!

Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund!

The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.

            "I can’t actually tell if it’s creamy and moisturising or drying after a while of wearing it. I think it’s really soft and creamy to apply and has fab coverage, but sometimes doesn’t work well with the procure i’ve applied on my face already. Must be due to the silicone in the formula - so potentially works much better with silicone based primers. Because after applying it after my spf, my under eyes looked dry and cakes and weird. which is odd cuz my spf is super glowy. so be careful before spending so much",
            "If you want a high coverage concealer - look no further! Love this concealer! This isn't a dewy, very moisturising, no-make-up type of concealer. Don't use too much and you can achieve a beautiful flawless result that isn't drying on the undereyes. The shade range is great too.",
            "Good concealer. \n\n                            I am a avid make up buyer but always feel like concealers are much of a much-ness. It's good, doesn't crease, brightnening (if brought in the right shade).",
            "High coverage but needs setting with powder as it creases. I'm using it as a brightening concealer rather than a blemish covering as it's a bit too creamy for that imo. I set it with a powder puff and a loose powder. Will probably try another brand when it runs out.",
            "I’m never going back to too faced! This is the creamiest concealer and a little goes a long way! Only sort of complaint would be about the packaging itself, after a few uses it does start to leak!"

Changing from muted green to a subtle, beige tint, the cream cushions your complexion with an array of ultra-nourishing ingredients.

            "I got this after hearing lots of good things about it but I definitely regret it somewhat. Yes it is great for reducing redness and I feel my skin has been less red overall while using it but this is a very, very heavy feeling product and it sinks into every wrinkle and pore I have even if I use a primer underneath it, which kind of defeats the purpose, since I'm sure that impedes the ingredients that help reduce redness. I find it takes a long time to dry down and if you have greasy skin you might really struggle with this. Also this is in no way going to work for darker skin tones because I'm very pale and this makes me look even paler.",

            "This product is amazing! \n                            It get rid of redness and act like a fondation. Careful though it won't work on darker skin tone and is on the dry side. But for me works wonder. I use a chemical sunscreen that hydrate underneath and it's perfect.",
            "I regret spending my money on this, it did nothing for me. Takes forever to blend, leaves weird grey cast on, and worst of all - settles into every single crease and pore! How can this be so expensive and how did it get good reviews I don’t know, maybe if someone has already perfect skin - but I’m 36, am told I look 10 years younger and my skin is great - and  this somehow makes my skin look bad! \n                            It’s a shame as I was eyeing this product up for a while and decided to finally splurge - I wish I haven’t!",
            "A little goes a long way. I don't think this product is for me or peoplewith skin like mine. Whilst my skin is on the fairer side it still leaves a white cast or residue and I scar more purple/brown or darker so it doesn't really work on new scars.",

It’s the perfect base (following your normal skincare) and I sometimes wear a tinted spf over it or I just dab a lil bit of concealer if we’re having a good skin day and go. Honestly it just smooths and evens everything out and I refuse to be without it.",
            "Idk if it helps with treating reddish skin, but it does cover brilliantly and it looks like I have bare skin. Don’t use too much!",
            "Literally such a game changer. Over skin care but under makeup. It makes my foundation sit so much more nicely and I can get away with just chucking this on without makeup if I’m running about town. Highly recommend to anyone with red cheeks or prone to spots. It’s a game changer."

            "A good dewy foundation that lasts well on the skin. I’m quite oily and have found after 6ish hours this will start to move around on the skin.",
            "Light to medium coverage, moisturising and natural.",
            "love this foundation. i have oily skin and looks great through the day. not too heavy",
            "I own about 20 foundations, and this is by far my favourite. I often struggle to get my foundation to lay correctly on my skin and have to reapply like 4 times over to get it right. This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

            "I like this foundation, but I don't love it. The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

            "I love CT but for some reason I don’t get on with her foundations. Airbrush settles in every line and this broke me out and slipped off my combo skin after a few hours.",
            "A good dewy foundation that lasts well on the skin. I’m quite oily and have found after 6ish hours this will start to move around on the skin.",
            "Light to medium coverage, moisturising and natural.",
            "love this foundation. i have oily skin and looks great through the day. not too heavy",
            "I own about 20 foundations, and this is by far my favourite. I often struggle to get my foundation to lay correctly on my skin and have to reapply like 4 times over to get it right. This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund!

            "Obviously a cult favourite but did not disappoint! A little goes a very long way and creates a filter like finish. Blends beautifully and lasts well.",
            "I like this foundation, but I don't love it. The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

            "Obviously a cult favourite but did not disappoint! A little goes a very long way and creates a filter like finish. Blends beautifully and lasts well.",
            "I like this foundation, but I don't love it. The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

This always works first time. I have combination skin, so this can get very shiny, but it never breaks down. Really smooth, luminous, medium coverage. Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

You can invest in the original full size Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment {here}!Working to cover blemishes while acting as a physical barrier against damaging environmental aggressors, this formula promises more than just a pretty face. Changing from muted green to a subtle, beige tint, the cream cushions your complexion with an array of ultra-nourishing ingredients. Formulated with a centella asiatica (tiger grass) complex to protect, extracts of resurrection plants (houttuynia cordata and yarrow) to strengthen, and raspberry leaf extract to obscure inflammation, it's also infused with sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium to boost moisture and lessen the signs of fatigue, while a blend of minerals and panthenol soothes and hydrates. With a list like that, it's safe to say we're beyond obsessed.",

            "Absolutely beautiful stuff. I love how it changes from green to my skin tone. Perfect colour corrector!",
            "It is effective at reducing redness although a bit greasy feeling. Also not a fan of the scent dr jart puts in all their products…",
            "Works great to cover up redness around my nose and love to use it when I don't want to apply a full face of foundation. Doesn't always sit well on my chin but that may be from the skincare I use beforehand. Still it's amazing and will repurchase once finished!",
            "Made my face extra oily and a lil itchy, did cover some of the redness but it still peaks through",
            "A nice product, which combines the healing properties of cica and the colour-correcting green pigment. I like it, but don't need to use it often. I can imagine that this would be brilliant for anyone suffering from rosacea though.",
            "I've never been able to wake up early enough in the morning to apply foundation before work, but this product reduces my redness and gives me enough coverage to make me feel so much more confident and its a lot quicker than doing skin makeup. The downside is that it's quite pale, but I love that it's working to heal my skin at the same time.",
            "Absolutely love this for redness! Best colour corrector out there.",
            "This really transform any redness or uneven skin tone. Ive started wearing it alone and not needing foundation."

Long wearing and better with a matte setting spray, keeps oils at bay, but stays radiant."

            "Obviously a cult favourite but did not disappoint! A little goes a very long way and creates a filter like finish. Blends beautifully and lasts well.",
            "I like this foundation, but I don't love it. The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",
            "I will always fall back on this foundation. It gives a great flawless finish and photographs really well.",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

The vegan and cruelty-free formula (Leaping Bunny-approved, no less) plumps, smooths and encourages radiance, while the perfecting medium coverage evens the look of skin. Plus, it comes in a recyclable tube and you can have your pick of 30 beautiful shades. ",

A long-wearing, full coverage yet weightless formula, it blends onto skin effortlessly to grant a smooth, natural matte, soft focus finish that is both transfer-resistant and sweat-proof. Going above and beyond, Charlotte Tilbury has spiked this complexion hero with a hefty supply of skin-loving ingredients to hydrate, protect against harmful pollutants, grant a fresh cooling effect and even reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Then theres the incredible shade range to rave about, with 44 shades that have been crafted to match both undertones and overtones. Available in cool, neutral and warm undertones in fair, medium, tan and deep overtones  finding the perfect shade for you couldnt be easier!",

            "Not a go to for every day wear for me as I find it too heavy, but I do reach for it when I need good long lasting coverage eg attending an all day event. Good colour match and easy to work with. Doesn’t let me down when I need it.",
            "Obviously a cult favourite but did not disappoint! A little goes a very long way and creates a filter like finish. Blends beautifully and lasts well.",
            "I like this foundation, but I don't love it. The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",
            "I will always fall back on this foundation. It gives a great flawless finish and photographs really well.",
            "Having watched the ads & read reviews I was keen to try a new foundation. Using the CT colour selector (checking several times) the 5 Cool was recommended. Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",
            "Nice demi-matte finish which looks natural. They have a very good selection of shades with various undertones which complement different skin colors. Buildable and very easy to blend. Does not look cakey at all and sits well on the skin.",
            "This product has a very strong reputation so I decided to try it and I’m happy to say that it’s worth the hype",

            "Obviously a cult favourite but did not disappoint! A little goes a very long way and creates a filter like finish. Blends beautifully and lasts well.",
            "I like this foundation, but I don't love it. The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Very disappointed when it arrived, looked orange when just tried a tiny amount on my skin! Tried to return as per guarantee, but Cult do not adhere to CT promise. Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund! In future buy from CT direct, they are the only ones who will stuck by their colour guarantee! Very disappointed & left high & dry for my neice’s wedding.",

The shades are good, I am very pale and use shade 1, which is slightly too yellow for me (I have a corpse-like undertone), but I can make it work.  The coverage is amazing, so only a little is needed, but it isn't very spreadable, so works better when you mix something else into it.  I have a drier skin, so find I need to moisturise well prior to application. Because I can't just slap this on my face without much thought, it only gets 3/5 from me!",

Tried CT who said I’d need to get refund from supplier if. Cult as their promise to refund if the wrong colour is universal! Cult disagree so I’ve been left with an orange foundation & no refund!

        "description": "Like a dermatologist on retainer (who takes appointments from your couch...), Qure Skincare’s Q-Rejuvalight Pro brings clinical-grade light therapy into your hands. Backed by clinical research and dermatologist approved, the innovative face mask can treat blemishes, fine line, wrinkles and more with just three minutes of use a day.How? Infrared light penetrates deepest into the skin, amplifying results and enhancing product absorption; deep red with infrared light accelerates skin healing to fade and prevent scarring, as well as diminishing wrinkles and age spots; red light stimulates collagen and elastin production, firming and plumping skin as it reduce redness and inflammation; amber light reduces the visibility of dark spots and calms swelling and inflammation; finally, anti-bacterial blue light fights and prevents blemishes. You can tailor each of these therapies to five different areas of your face via the compatible app too! The results of its clinical studies are no joke: with daily use, 87% experienced smoother facial wrinkles and fine lines after 12 weeks; 91% reported improved skin tone and enhanced smoothness after 12 weeks; finally, there was 83% reduction of moderate acne after 8 weeks. ",

            "It seems to be a good mask, I'm not seeing mind blowing results with it, but it feels nice to apply for a few mines per day, feels pampering",
            "Have used this mask for 8 weeks and skin does seem to have more glow to it. Feel like it’s more manageable than having an LED mask you have to wear for 20mins. 3 minutes and you’re done for the day.",
            "I bought this a month ago and have used almost daily since then.  I have definitely seen an improvement in the quality of my skin and texture.  I was torn between this and a wand and so glad i went with the mask, you don't need to use anything with it for slip and I use it as part of my night skincare routine after i've cleansed my face. \n\n                            It has 2 different light settings and if using with the app it will time the treatment and turn off automatically once the treatment time is complete.  Really easy to use, I do one of each light treatment to target different concerns although the app does allow for a more targeted approach.  \n\n                            The reason this doesn't get top marks for me is because it's not the most comfortable thing to wear, an additional strap at the bottom of the mask would be helpful.  Also the app is pretty basic and quite often it's a bit of a faff to connect it with the mask, also it according to the app the mask doesn't seem to fully charge but it generally lasts a full week which seems similar to other reviews. \n\n                            Overall though I think this is a good investment.",
            "Can’t say much as I have only used it for a few weeks - though I do feel like the texture of my skin has improved.",
            "Great mask with both blue and red LED light for acne and aging. User friendly and the ability to have different lights on different sections of the face using the app is amazing.",
            "I’m using it for three weeks now, once a day red light and I think my skintexture is improving. I don’t like the Qure Skincare App as for some reason its not recording some days od my 8-week scheduled treatment",
            "This mask has changed my face! My skin looks more vibrant",
            "Have been using this for a few months, and I think I see an improvement in the tone of my skin. The only thing I don't like is the way it presses against the skin - I started noticing breakouts on my cheeks where it pressed (unusual place for breakouts for me), and when I stopped using it they resolved. I've tried cleaning the mask with anti-bac wipe after use, and the breakouts still came back. Now I hold it away from my skin and that seems fine. It's only 3 minutes a day so it's not totally inconvenient, but I do wish it didn't strap so tightly to the face. In terms of light therapy, however it works. It terms of design, I think it might be bothersome for some with sensitive skin.",

            "My usual SPF has been out of stock for quite a while so decided to try this after reading reviews and it didn't disappoint. My skin tolerates this very well, absorbs quickly and sits well under make-up. A definite value for money option for me, will buy again.",
            "This is a repurchase! I really love this SPF, it has a great texture that applies easily, doesn't sting my eyes, and doesn't leave a white cast. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy, but hydrated, like you do after a good moisturiser application. My only gripe is that I do find it leaves my (very sensitive) skin every so slightly irritated. Just a very slight warmth and prickling of my cheeks afterward. Its not enough to make me want to stop using the product just yet (as I'm yet to find a better alternative) but if you also have very sensitive skin maybe borrow from a friend first!",
            "This is a lovely hydrating sunscreen that I always go back to after trying other brands.  It sinks into my dry skin really well and doesn't leave a white cast or clog my pores.  It's also soothing and gentle on my rosacea and protects the skin effectively,  A firm favourite that I will keep rebuying!",
            "The best spf which does not irritate my sensitive skin, really moisturising. I know it’s expensive but it’s worth it"

        "description": "Intensely nourishing, this luxurious Avocado Melt Retinol Eye Sleeping Mask is crammed with moisturising, age-defying and brightening ingredients to leave you looking bright eyed and bushy tailed come morning. Rich in antioxidants including conditioning vitamins E and C, avocado oil and extract soothes and nourishes the delicate under-eye area while protecting it against harmful environmental aggressors like free radicals. Other hard-working ingredients include niacinamide, which helps to strengthen the skin’s barrier while visibly improving the appearance of dullness, fine lines and wrinkles, along with caffeine-laced coffeeberry to reduce puffiness and dark circles. The star of the show? Encapsulated retinol, which helps to firm, smooth and plump fine lines and wrinkles without the harsher side effects often associated with retinol. The encapsulation allows the ingredient to sink deeper into skin and release its youth-prolonging powers more slowly, making it gentler than other traditional retinol formulas. On top of being Ophthalmologist & Dermatologist Tested, the sleeping mask is free of all kinds of questionable ingredients and chemicals, including synthetic fragrances, mineral oil, parabens, sulphates and silicones!

            "makes my undereyes feel very soft and have to use little product each time.",
            "Most retinol of any type tends to dry my skin out but this has worked excellently on my eyes and is very moisturising and brightening. Instantly my undereyes felt nicer and has helped concealer seperation. Quite pricey however i only had to use a tiny amount due to the consistency and so i can see it lasting a long time",
            "Love this cream. I don’t use it solely as an eye sleeping mask. It’s part of my AM and PM routine. The consistency was initially a surprise, as it seems quite thick, however it goes on so smoothly and does not feel heavy. So glad I tried this brand!",
            "I love this! It’s pricey but it lasts such a long time, it is very thick so a little goes along way. I can see it makes a difference and will carry on purchasing it for as long as it’s around 😊",
            "I have loved using this eye cream, it’s really helped with my puffiness",
            "I've been using this for about 2 or 3 years (been using retinol all over my face for longer than that so my skin was already used to it even around my eyes).\n                            This is a very gentle retinol, I can use this daily with nu irritation whatsoever. I absolutely LOVE the texture, it's very rich, deeply moisturizing and (because it is so thick), a little goes a long way so it lasts quite a long time.\n                            Altogether, one of my favorite products from Glow Recipe.",
            "Can spot a different straight away if I do not use this now after time! Amazing at keeping the bags away",
            "Ive not noticed a masssive difference but my eyes don’t seem as dark underneath, its still early days. A little goes a long way i dont even use a pea sized amount. It doesnt feel thick either glides on. Definitely absorbs quick",
            "I picked this eye cream on a whim and I’m obsessed with it and will reorder it. Only wish is that it wasn’t in a pot you have to put your finger in.",
            "Excellent eye cream. I use others then come back to it every time. Calming and quickly absorbed, makes my under eye feel hydrated and comfortable."

There is no cast, it’s super smooth and sits well under make up. Most other ones I have tried tend to pill under make up. It does have a slight fake tan smell I think and it is higher on the price point so the only reason for not giving 5 stars.",

Beautifully ‘bouncy’, this rich gel cleanser works into a gentle lather to erase make up and impurities while also deeply hydrating skin, so much so that you might well no longer need to use a hydrating toner. Offering two benefits in one, it can be used as a moisturising cleanser and a quenching, deep-cleaning mask when left on for five to eight minutes. Brimming with blueberry, a renowned antioxidant powerhouse, this cleanser protects, strengthens and clarifies skin, while gentle alpha hydroxy acids (including glycolic and lactic acids) exfoliate dead skin cells for renewed radiance. With the adition of hyaluronic acid, this leaves your complexion soft, hydrated, dewy and bouncy, as well as perfectly prepped for skin care that follows, this cleanser is more than a little covetable!",

Star of the show is squalane, a first-class hydrator that’s found naturally in the skin, helping to prevent loss of moisture and boost suppleness. This combines with other lipophilic esters to dissolve make up and unwanted grime for clean and clog-free pores. The hard-working formula feels balm-like when first applied, changing to a clear oil-like texture when warmed into your skin – an important feat that allows emulsifying sucrose esters to capture the dissolved make up and dirt and rinse them away. Free from soap, which can cause irritation or ‘strip’ the skin, this crowd-pleasing cleanser respects your complexion’s natural epidermal lipids, making it suitable for all skin types – even sensitive ones.

            "This product is so good and made my skin so smooth and soft. i use this everyday and love it 😍",

            "Remove my make up almost instantly and very hydrating. Love this and the entire line of products.",
            "I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser and this looked like it would fit the bill - it's definitely better value but the texture isn't as nice, imo. In terms of what it does for my skin it seems to be on par. Not drying, doesn't make my skin feel stripped of moisture or its natural oils, but a nice clean feeling.",
            "Used by my daughter, lovely cleanser and doesn’t irritate her sensitive skin. She’s very happy!",

            "I found this too drying, made my face squeaky clean. Perhaps better suited to oily skin or summer as it would probably do a great job at taking off sunscreen. I have sensitive and breakout prone skin and this didn't make me breakout.",
            "I love this cleanser! I have normal skin and it’s really good, it leaves my skin nice and soft after I use it. super cute packaging",
            "Love this product, it doesn’t dry my skin out after using which i usually struggle to find, lathers up great as well!",
            "Lovely cleanser - not too stripping but still lathers up well and makes your skin feel clean after using. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Love the pump dispenser as you get the perfect amount without any mess."

        "description": "You don't need to choose between picture-perfect make up and sun-protected skin any longer with the Anthelios Anti-Shine Face Mist SPF 50. The first of its kind in the Anthelios line, this moisturising but mattifying mist delivers a double anti-shine action with an ultra-dry finish and sits flawlessly on top of make up throughout the day.Freshly fragranced for the ultimate holiday mode pick-me-up, La Roche-Posay's high protection mist makes SPF top-ups a dream and not just a necessity. Sensitive oily and blemish-prone skin can thank NASA (yes, you heard us right) for the oil-absorbing benefits this SPF mist brings. 'Airlicium' is used by the famous aeronautic experts and has been put to work in this formulation to form a supple and resistant film over the skin while smoothing texture and allowing it to really breathe. If that wasn't enough for you it absorbs three times its weight in oil! Protected and mattified skin is just a mist away thanks to La Roche-Posay. We're just saying if it's good enough for astronauts...",

        "description": "A next-generation, universal-fit full-face model, this innovative device sits comfortably over the entire face while still actively targeting the entire area, using a total of 100 red LED lights (to stimulate the natural production of collagen and elastin to reduce wrinkles, sun spots, sun damage and redness) and 62 blue LED lights (which destroys bacteria and prevents future breakouts). Choose from three treatment options, red light therapy, blue light therapy or red and blue light therapy which targets wrinkles and spots at the same time. You’ll start to notice surface changes and reduced blemishes in as little as two weeks and 97% of subjects in Dr Dennis Gross’ clinical study showed visible improvements in fine lines, wrinkles, skin tone and breakouts over a 10-week period of daily use. We like those odds! With a universal USB charging cord, detachable, adjustable head strap, convenient storage bag and a full instructional manual included, we’re struggling to think of a reason not to snap one up…",

            "I was wanting to purchase this for months but finally went for it. It is very easy to use and clean.  I would say I have a smaller face so I was unsure how well it would fit but it fits fine and the strap is very comfortable and makes it feel secure. I’m interested to see the benefits over the month to come",
            "I've been debating buying the Dr Dennis Gross DRX Spectralite Faceware Pro, and I am so glad that I have! I've been using this everyday for the past two weeks, and some of my fine lines are already reducing in appearance. \n\n                            It's very easy to use, keep clean, and doesn't get hot during use!\n\n                            I will say, I did purchase this in a sale with a gift card and some rewards, so girl math definitely justified this purchase. It is an investment into your skincare, but I think it's worth it!",
            "It’s a splurge but it’s well worth it - my fine lines have reduced significantly, especially around my eyes and some id noticed when I smile. I use it consistently every day. I did see great results with the blue light therapy on my chin acne but this seems to have come back now",
            "I have always struggled with me skin. Hormonal acne on my chin, pigmentation and just general dull tone. Literally within a week of using this I can see a difference. My skin is so much brighter and it caught a deep hormonal spot and stopped it in its tracks. I was so so skeptical about buying due to the cost but I am completely converted. Worth every Penny.",
            "This is unbelievable. Hands down game changing. It’s expensive but I feel it’s really worth it, haven’t been using long enough to see a huge change in my skin from an ageing perspective but has made a huge difference is my skins general glow/inflammation reduction etc",
            "I’ve owned this for around 9 months now and can confirm I really love it! I started the year with lots of skin issues that have subsided with this and other skin care. Love using it a few times a week. Reallt works",
            "I've been using this day in day out since I bought it around 6-7 weeks ago. I see no changes in my skin with ageing signs or any reduction in spots/pimples. Maybe it will take considerably longer, particuarly with the signs of ageing but I thought my area around my chin where I suffer from regular breakouts would have improved. I will stick at it and hope I haven't wasted my money.",
            "Looked at this for so long as it’s a considered purchase but it’s been around awhile and consistently gets good reviews still so when I got a discount around my birthday I thought it was time. Love the fact it’s only3 minutes so makes it easy to commit too. Looking forward to the results!",
            "I like using LED masks at home and have seen results with one I bought before this one. But the programme was over 3x longer (10mins) which meant it always felt like a hassle to include it and my skin also dried out while using it. What I like most about this is that it only takes 3mins, which means I’ve used it everyday since purchasing and have seen the same results as using my older mask. I don’t really get breakouts, so haven’t used the blue light setting, but the red setting definitely keeps my inflammation at bay, so everything looks fresher and calmer with consistent use. Unlike others I’ve found no issues with the silicone strap - I can easily walk around the house with it on and it feels secure.",
            "Have been using daily for a few weeks and can see the difference! Lines are less visible, any breakouts clear quickly. Worth every penny. Easy to use, and worth the investment."

            "I've been using NuFACE's Mini for four years and have tried loads of different facial gels, plus the Silk Cremé in the range, and none of them are as effective as the Aqua Gel for me. Compared to others: I have sensitive skin and this doesn't sting or create red patches and when applied evenly you don't suddenly hit a dry spot where the Mini drags the skin or the current stings. It's expensive for what it is but then it's effective and I find two pumps covers the areas I'm massaging. The top dispenser cap on this size is also a bit fiddly if you have wrist mobility issues.

        "description": "Fancy starting the weekend early? Give your skin the Friday feeling (whether or not youve just switched time zones) with SUMMER FRIDAYS' Jet Lag Mask. An established Instagram sensation, the beauty world has long sworn its undying love for this heroic hydrating mask, not least because its received rave reviews from the likes of Kim Kardashian and Jessica Alba.Upgraded to reap the best results as physically possible, the iconic mask is now crafted with a skin-soothing blend of vitamin B5, allantoin and bisabolol, and without the likes of essential oils to prevent potential irritation. Perfect for stressed-out skin and ideal for post-plane complexions, the vegan formula drenches skin with a nourishing mix of vitamins, ceramides, antioxidants and gently exfoliating extracts, which work together to soothe and hydrate skin, plumping away the look of fine lines and wrinkles to leave things uber-dewy. Humectant hero, glycerin locks in dryness-relieving moisture to promote a soft, supple finish while hyaluronic acid helps to draw in moisture and niacinamide reduces the appearance of pores and imperfections. The brand's fabulous founders also love to use the mask as a hydrating primer or an overnight treatment for more intensive effects.",
        "reviews": [
            "I use this product every night and in the morning my skin is soft snd looking fresh.",
            "Very hydrating mask, took it to travel and really helped to keep skin calm. Cannot use has a primer, it doesn`t skin in, but has a mask perfect.",
            "I love this. It seems quite expensive for the size of the tube, but is a very thick and moisturising mask. Not a huge amount is required to cover the face. It leaves skin very plump and soft afterwards",
            "My second tube. I use it every single night without fail. Sometimes on its own and sometimes with something under it. I have quite dry skin and I’m prone to breakouts too if I use too many actives on my skin. I’ve had zero breakouts since using this nightly and no dryness either. It just balances my skin perfectly and I love it",
            "This is a multi use mask. Can be used as a rich moisturiser and not wiped off. Or more can be put on for an intense hydration hit",
            "Life saver for dry skin, especially for winter",
            "I wasn’t wowed by this product as much as I’d heard raving reviews, it’s ok! I got it to hydrate my skin in the winter and when I used it as an over night mask I almost felt like it felt slightly matte dry on the skin after a while. I don’t find myself reaching for it often but it’s an ok product overall",
            "I love this moisturiser it feels thick and hydrating, perfect for winter deffo something I’d repurchase",
            "i\"ve been using it as an overnight mask and it's kept my skin hydrated for the morning",
            "This is my Holy Grail I cannot live without this product it's so hydrating my skin drinks it up and leaves me glowing even better it's such a multitasker you can use as a moisturiser eye cream face mask and anywhere else that needs moisture"

However, I find that these masks really help and I can tell a difference after using them! I’ve tried so many products in the past that haven’t made a difference, but these really do and so I always repurchase! It’s great value for the amount of masks you get in a container! It’s so relaxing sitting with a cuppa for half an hour in a morning wearing these masks!",

        "description": " Who said you need endless lotions and potions to keep your skin in tip-top health? For beauties that prefer a more minimal routine, CeraVe’s Moisturising Cream — perfect for enriching your face and body with nourishment and moisture — is one for you. As with all CeraVe superheroes, at the core of this rich (but quick to absorb) formula is a cocktail of three essential ceramides (lipids that are essentially the ‘glue’ of your skin barrier). Flooding your skin with these ceramides helps to keep that skin barrier in tip-top health, helping to maintain moisture levels and keep irritation, sensitivity and eczema at bay. CeraVe’s unique ‘MVE Technology’ means you get even more from these ceramides; it ensures they’re gradually released over time to ensure long-lasting nourishment and hydration. Throw in a healthy dose of moisture-slurping hyaluronic acid, and this formula promises to really care for skin (even if it’s ultra-dry!). If you struggle with grumpy, pernickety skin that just doesn’t seem to get on with many creams, this may just be the answer — it’s fragrance free, non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic. Phew!",

            "This is a lovely moisturising cream. My eye area feels plumped and nourished after use and it creates a great base before eye makeup. The tube is small however it lasts a really long time since you only use a tiny bit each time. The cream seems like it would be thick and sit around the eyes for ages but it actually absorbs into the skin quite quickly. I will definitely be repurchasing this product.",
            "This is a great all round affordable eye cream. Great texture absorbed by the skin. Helps reduce fine lines & leaves the eye area feeling plumped & moisturised.",
            "This cream is soothing and moisturising, not too thick or heavy. It also works as a really great base before eyeshadow and concealer. The skin around my eyes feels soft and smooth. Will definitely be repurchasing.",

            "So affordable and does what it says. Sits well under make up and makes me feel awake!",

            "Been struggling with allergic reactions and my eye area has been particularly sensitive. I have spent a small fortune on eye creams and eventually gave this one a go, which is probably the cheapest eye cream I have ever used. \n                            I really like it, no reactions and moisturizing, good with makeup too. Great value",
            "This is my go to night eye cream, it's a bit too heavy for me for the day, but it is very hydrating. I highly recommend this",

It's light, sinks in really well, never pills and plays really well with other products/sunscreen. It feels hydrating and soothing when it goes on and is fragrance free and non-irritating so doesn't affect my sensitive eyes. I have dark undereyes and can't say it's made a huge difference in that sense (although that is more due to think skin vs pigmentation), but it's helped with hydration and puffiness. Also please note: the short pump is not broken, it's how it's supposed to be (it's a new/different design and works fine).",

        "description": "A best-smelling must-have, Nuxe's Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil for Face, Body and Hair is a buffet of goodness for compromised skin - cherishing dry, scaly patches (and strengthening over-styled lengths!) with a medley of plant-derived oils.Completely non-greasy and quickly absorbed, this leaves a light lustre and works to replenish and comfort the scaliest limbs... A holiday hero (slather this all over post-sun skin), the blend of camellia, hazelnut, sweet almond, St. John's wort, macadamia and borage has impressive healing properties - working to elasticise and fortify while boosting moisture levels to promote a healthy glow. Rake through the ends of your hair to create a chic 'piecey-ness', smooth over shoulders or streak down the length of your shins to bestow an au naturel highlight. A multi-tasking wonder, there's a reason no routine should be without it.",

Ideal for blemish-prone, oily or combination types, this non-abrasive formula is laced with BHA salicylic acid to remove dead skin cells both on the skin's surface and within the pore. Combined with its anti-inflammatory properties, this helps to reduce blemishes and blackheads for a more clarified complexion (hurrah!). Aiding salicylic acid in its blemish-clearing mission, methylpropanediol enhances absorption so you can get the most out of each and every ingredient, while simultaneously boosting hydration levels, and green tea extract delivers a hefty dose of antioxidants to soothe and protect. With a fluid toner-like consistency, the formula sinks easily into skin and is available in both full (118ml) and travel (30ml) sizes so you need never be without... ",

If you’re struggling with your ‘z’s’ and looking for something to give you a helping hand then look no further than Glow Recipe’s new targeted eye treatment. Adding to the line of fruity favourites is the Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream — infused with hardworking actives that target the common concerns around the delicate eye area. Optimised with a 10% encapsulated vitamin C complex and 3% niacinamide blend to brighten dark circles and even tone, this is the quick way to elude to 8 hours sleep (even when you’ve had half that).

        "description": "As essential as taking your house keys everywhere, your tote bag checklist isn't complete without the Tripeptide Plumping Lip Balm (10ml) from The INKEY List.  This triple-action lip care staple does the job of plumping, hydrating, repairing and smoothing compromised skin to reveal fuller, noticeably plumped lips within just two weeks. Specially formulated for maximum fullness without any tingling or irritation, this plumping balm works over time to visibly increase lip volume. How? It's backed by a Tripeptide Complex, nourishing mango seed and shea butters, plus a plethora of plant-powered oils. Overall, this barrier-supportive balm helps retain moisture, define lip contours and improve the texture of your lips over time. It also leaves a natural sheen on the lips which can be worn alone or over lip colour for a glossy finish. ",
        "reviews": [
            "So you are meant to use this three times a day for a couple of weeks for plump results. Before I see those results, it is a nice lip balm/gloss.",
            "I have medium sized lips and notice that they get smaller throughout the day (probably dehydration) but I do feel my lips more plumped through the day. The only downside is that it doesn't last long, but it gives a great shine and gloss! Not sticky at all either.",
            "It's a really good lip balm",
            "Great little tube of balm, I particularly like the applicator meaning I don’t have to use my fingers, and the ingredients include moisturiser as well as humectant, in addition to the peptides. No scent & it is quite thick, but then i don’t think any of their products contain scent. \n\n                            Not as good as Paula’s Choice Lip Boost, but it’s less than half the price. Will be repurchasing.",
            "Plus: doesn't taste of anything, no smell, lasts a fair bit on, nice hydrating effect.\n                            Minus: the tube is useless, smears the product well outside of the lip area, I end up wiping most of it away. Noticed no plumping effect.",
            "Have been using this three times a day as recommended, can’t say I’ve noticed a huge difference but is a good lip balm and I do think my lips look slightly fuller than before - have only been using for around 2 weeks so interested to see if there’s much more plumping to come!",
            "quite expensive for a lip balm but i do love it and i have noticed my lips are slightly bigger - super hydrating aswell x",
            "I cannot believe the results after 2 weeks .. my lips are looking more plumper than ever",
            "Can feel the product visibly softening lips after a couple of applications. Will have to use it longer to see it’s plumping effects",
            "I’ve only been using for a few weeks so I haven’t had enough time to give it a full chance but I definitely feel like my lips are looking a bit plumper. Excited to see the results after a full month"

        "description": "Water- and silicone-free, The Ordinary’s Retinol 0.5% in Squalane features highly stable retinol, an ingredient that can reduce the appearance of ageing with impressive results. A powerhouse form of vitamin A, retinol encourages cell turnover, revealing healthier, softer skin while also tackling blemishes, dark spots and defying signs of ageing – including softening the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and uneven tone. Retinol can cause significant irritation, including redness and peeling – but many feel that its significant effects counterbalance this; The Ordinary recommends building your skin’s tolerance to retinol with lower concentrations such as {Retinol 0.2% in Squalane} to minimise discomfort.",

I use it every AM and it honestly made the world of difference to my skin. My little secret to make it less abrasive is to put it on a cotton pad and rub it on the skin (rather than applying it directly and leaving it in).",
            "Used this for years, then forgot to repurchase. It’s brilliant and I won’t go without it again. Extremely gentle. Easy to wash off, no redness. Mostly use in the evening (x2 weekly) but if I want a quick slough in the morning, then three minutes does the job.",

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) exfoliate the skin’s topmost layer for a brighter, more even appearance, while beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) exfoliate the skin more deeply to clear pore congestion – together, they radically improve the appearance of the skin’s texture and reduce the look of fine lines. Don’t be perturbed by the irritation often associated with acid use – The Ordinary’s AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution also features Tasmanian pepperberry to reduce inflammation, as well as a crosspolymer form of hyaluronic acid for comfort, vitamin B5 to assist healing and black carrot as an antioxidant.

Taking you on a sensory journey to Brazil (think: Rio’s Copacabana beach), this silky formula is fast-absorbing and packed with restorative ingredients for a gorgeous dewy finish.  Let’s start with a fun fact about the hero ingredient: copaiba oil. It’s been used in Brazil for centuries as a natural healer after locals observed animals rubbing themselves against the trunk of the copaiba tree when wounded. This, alongside cold-pressed rosehip and buriti oils, makes Copa Dew a true wonder product (and multi-tasker!), brimming with nourishing antioxidants and vitamins to give your skin, hair and body the ultimate glow-up. In fact, you can even use it as a bath oil. The uplifting scent has been created with a blend of upcycled apple oil and notes of white tea, cedarwood and lemon peel. Dreamy doesn’t even cut it. ",

            "Lovely oil smell I don't think it's that amazing but ok but it's not greasy and on hair it's to die for",
            "I purchased it solely based on the reviews here and I am not disappointed! It is moisturizing, absorbs quickly, and smells sweet/floral but is not overpowering. The fragrance lingers on for a couple of hours. I also use it on the pulse points before spraying perfume to make it last even longer. Would have given it five stars if it came in a large size with a pump for ease of use. I will definitely purchase it again :)",

            "Currently obsessed with this intoxicating oil, it leaves my limbs, looking glossy without that sticky feeling and smells like an absolute dream. A must have for anyone looking to achieve glassy limbs without the residue that most body oils leave on the skin. I only wish it was available in a larger size with a pump. Isadora, this is my official request for a jumbo Copa Dew Oil!",
            "I bought this oil, to use on my vacation, as it is a multitasking product - can be used on hair, face and body. I'm still at my home, but gave it a try and I cannot stop using it :), I'm using it on my hair and face for now and  it is lovely, it smells fresh and natural, it sinks into the skin - so I can use it day or night. The dispenser system make it a little bit hard to get out, but on the plus side no worries that you will pour to much and waste it. Over all and lovely multitasking oil, for those who like using  oil in their routines.",

            "It was viral on social media and I can see why, but unfortunately didn’t suit my skin type and really clogged pores. I love how rich and calming it is but I rather be using something else without shea butter.",
            "I was sent 3 sample tubes of this - and decided to use them on my neck... I couldn't believe how effective it was and so I bought a full-sized tube... don't be fooled by the price (it's cheap in beauty terms!)... I absolutely love it... makes my skin super-soft and hydrated and I think my neck lines in particular have improved significantly... there are a lot of expensive neck creams on the market, even if you just bought it for that, I don't think you'd regret it at all ! I found this cream particularly nice after a day of sun... it felt nourishing and repairing - which I guess is exactly what it says it is !",

Expect kiss-proof colour, a fuller-looking pout and an orderly queue of admirers.  This luscious matte lipstick is designed to hydrate and protects lips with a delicate blend of oils and waxes, together with 'lipstick tree' and orchid extracts. Rich in light-diffusing pigments to create the illusion of enhanced fullness, the colour payoff is second-to-none (think: velvety-textured but non-drying) for a runway-worthy make up look. Application is effortless too, thanks to an innovative squared-off angled tip, which mirrors the precision of a lip brush for the most perfectly defined line and cupid's bow. This Bauble stars the original nude pink shade, 'Pillow Talk', which has become an icon in its own right.  Contents:  Matte Revolution Lipstick in 'Pillow Talk' (1.5g) ",

        "description": "We're pretty sure it's not just us that has spent hours on end trying to grapple with a barrel brush and hair dryer to create the hairdresser-level blow-dry at home… only to end up with aching arms and frizzy, flat hair that simply refuses to cooperate. If this picture resonates a little too profoundly with you then (thankfully) Drybar has just the tool to solve all your hair woes. The Double Shot Oval Blow-Dryer Brush combines the hot air of a hair dryer with the structure and shape of a round brush to help you create the lusted-after blowout of dreams. Gone are the days of trying to coordinate two tools and constantly rest your aching arms, this does all the work for you. Great for hair types from wavy to curly and poker straight, this ergonomically-designed tool is lightweight and easy to use so you can style your hair stress-free. Customise your blowout with three temperature settings, and the combination of nylon and tufted bristles brings you total control and optimal tension over your tresses.

            "I’m not great with hair, so still trying to master this!",
            "As someone who has never been able to blow dry my hair without it becoming a frizzy mess this is just what I needed! Took next to no time and was so tamed! I cant wait to experiment more with it, having only used it twice im still figuring it out but would fully recommend!",
            "This amazing brush is fantastic quality. I have long thick curly hair and this has halved the time it takes to do my hair. Absolutely a must.",
            "This brush is really good has 3 heat settings great for smoothing out frizzy hair.",
            "I bought this on Sali Hughes's recommendation as I can never get the same results as my hairdresser's blow dry in the salon. This very much does the job, although I like to use this on damp to-dry hair, not wet. It is quite big and heavy so not fool-proof, but I can manage it.",
            "Love this. Cuts out the hassle of juggling a hair dryer and round brush to get the ideal bouncy blow dry.",
            "As someone who has never been good at anything hair related, this is amazing. I’m a novice so maybe I’m not the most qualified person to review but if you’re rubbish at doing your hair like me then I’d recommend. Gives my fine hair a lot more volume and shape that lasts. I use the Amika mousse at the roots to help with the lift and so far I love it. I recommend blasting your hair to get it around 70% dry before sectioning and styling with this. Didn’t buy it to cut down drying time, just to help me style my hair as I struggled with a normal dryer and a round brush. This is lightweight and super easy to use and grips your hair so it doesn’t fly off as it gets dry. No frizz either. I’m happy anyway!",
            "After my Revlon blow dry brush finally broke I decided to give this a go. Although it does dry my hair it doesn’t give the same smoothness or volume as my Revlon. I wouldn’t purchase this again and once this breaks I’ll be getting another Revlon.",
            "I really really wanted to love as I wanted a tool that would give me a bouncy blow dry. I have super thick hair so I had to dry my hair a lot before using and it just didn't make the process quicker. Right after finishing my hair did look great but about ten minutes later my hair was poker straight, I couldn't get the bounce to stay! I also feel that after a few uses the bristles would already be ruined. Maybe more suited for thing hair?",
            "Love this! Have thick mid length curly/ wavy hair and don’t usually style my hair smooth. This is super easy to use, gives lots of volume and an easy quite natural smooth blow out. From other reviews I don’t use ok wet hair but let my hair dry 90% before using the brush.  Would recommend and buy again if needed."

Like the name, it’s a modern formula that’s smudge-proof (yet easy to remove), volumising without clumping and gives immediate impact whilst coverage can be easily built for even more drama. Whether you have long or short, curly or straight, thick or sparse lashes, the hourglass brush grips and separates each and every lash, creating a fuller look. It’s also infused with lash-loving ingredients such as vitamins C and E to nourish and vegan beeswax and caranuba wax which helps to condition and coat the lashes. Sounds like a win-win to us.",
        "reviews": [
            "Already a huge fan of everything Vieve, so when this mascara came out I was eager to try it. I unfortunately have such a bad time when it comes to mascaras, as I have dead straight lashes, which in short, smudges under my eyes, as doesn't hold a curl. The packaging and the brush for this mascara is so stunning, and extremely volumizing. I think my favourite thing about this mascara is that it was super black and packed plenty of mascara on my lashes, however this dropped a star for me as I found it too wet and resulting in not holding my curl :(",
            "I don't get the hype on this, the packaging is lovely and heavy and its very black but that's it, it doesn't do anything a drug store mascara can't. Not worth the money.",
            "I don’t think I’d buy it again. It’s a nice mascara but the formula is quite wet so I find it difficult not to get it everywhere when I’m applying",
            "Brilliant mascara so easy to use, no irritation, no transfer, removed so easily. Is very wet when first applied to allow to dry before excessive blinking etc. my new mascara in my make up bag!",
            "Vieve has quickly become my favourite makeup brand - when they released a mascara I had to try it even though I've used the same mascara for years. This did not disappoint! I love how black it is, it doesn't smudge and it lengthens and thickens at the same time. It comes off easily with just water and I love that. I've spent the last 10 months growing my lashes and they're the healthiest they've ever been, so it's important to me that a mascara is easy to remove so I don't damage my lashes when removing my makeup",
            "I’ve had so many compliments on my eyelashes since buying this! It’s a great formula, lasts all day but comes off with water so easily.",
            "Nice brush and formula but I can’t apply this without it going all over my eyelids - wondering if it’s too wet? Shame as it does a great job on my lashes but the clean-up is a pain.",
            "I saw Sarah Jossel rave about this mascara so I bought it immediately and it did not disappoint! Amazing staying power, it doesn’t flake or bleed to my under eyes, and it’s removed just with water. Well done Jamie Genevieve, well worth the wait and an amazing product.",
            "I think this i a really good quality mascara. Its definitely smudge proof, easy to remove and does a fantastic job of coating/fanning the lashes. However, i dont feel like this is the most lengthening mascara. I need to go in with another mascara on top of this one to get my desired length",
            "Lovely formula, builds beautifully. Love that it’s so easy to take off so I don’t have to scrub at my sensitive eyes!"

        "description": "Betraying its chic, minimalist appearance, this brilliant bottle holds miracles. So much more than a hair treatment, OLAPLEX’s three-step ritual is a system that permanently rebuilds the damaged disulphide bonds in your hair – which are compromised as a result of colouring, heat styling and everyday wear and tear. A daily cleansing and repairing shampoo, this silky fluid deeply hydrates and strengthens hairs as well as repairing shattered hair bonds in between your salon or styling sessions, so you can carry on maintaining your favourite hair colour and style without the worry of damaging your hair beyond repair. No 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo formula is colour- sulphate- paraben- gluten- and nut-free, as well as vegan-friendly too. Use after the brand’s {No 3 Hair Perfector} weekly treatment and follow with the {No 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner}.",

            "Brilliant shampoo for thick, coarse hair. Great to eliminate frizz.",
            "This is an okay shampoo. It cleaned my hair well and made it feel quite soft but it also weighed it down a bit (I have quite fine hair). \n                            I felt like my scalp got oily faster than before using this. \n                            Apart from that my hair didn't feel any different even after a few weeks of using this, together with the conditioner. I think it's overpriced for what it delivers.",
            "I like to use it together with no.3 and olaplex hair conditioner. They work very well together and I personally have a good result after using them all as my hair routine. Definitely recommend purchasing this",
            "I have naturally blonde hair that is a little fragile. I have used olpalex for the last year and my hair is totally transformed. It’s healthier and stronger. Highly recommended.",
            "I was having spells of greasy hair, I’ve been using olaplex for 2 weeks now and my hair does greasy, in great condition and lasting longer in between washes.",
            "I've been putting my hair through a lot lately and this is a great fix. Highly recommended for overprocessed hair",
            "Excellent shampoo.  I sometimes try others but always end up back with No.4",
            "Very concentrated formula so a little goes a long way. It is not suitable for my fine hair as it is quite heavy and tends to weight my hair down.",
            "I only need a small amount of this shampoo for it to work as it’s very thick. It has a nice smell and leaves my hair looking great.",

        "reviews": [
            "My first purchase of this brand and am please with product, so will be buying more",
            "It’s a shame as the reviews I looked at were positive so that’s why I bought but I must say I’m not happy with how it leaves my lashes it’s application isn’t very good leaves the lashes with bits on & they stick together then there are clogged black pieces which fall onto your face which leave black specks Also this happens most the time during the day so you have to constantly check!! For the price that’s really poor!!!!",
            "A bit on the pricey side, but worth it. You can use it every day and add an extra layer for a more dramatic look. Will definitely re purchase.",
            "I bought one & it was incredible! So I bought another & it was completely different, the product was gloopy & I had to throw it away",
            "My new favorite mascara. The one I know I’ll be getting time and time again. \n                            Some of the reviews mention clumpy bits when trying to take it off but I actually prefer that, with a decent eye makeup remover and a good cleanse this stuff comes off really easily and holds really well all day. It’s definitely worth the money and combined with a good lash serum my lashes have never looked so good. Would definitely recommend and often get asked about my eyelashes.",
            "The mascara was okay, but nothing special. My eye lids were itchy and dry after using it, so not great for sensitive skin.",
            "So beautiful makes my eyelashes look super long!!",
            "I keep purchasing this incredible mascara over and over because its a superior formula that coats every lash, lengthens and defines every hair, and stays on all day with no cracking & crumbling ... it's simply the best!!",
            "This is a fantastic tubing mascara.  I find most mascara's smudge on me by the end of the day but this one, being a tubing mascara, doesn't.  I find it makes my lashes look fuller than other tubing mascara's.  If you're looking for a softer and thicker look, I think traditional mascaras work best for that, but if panda eyes are a problem for you then tubing is definitely the way to go!",
            "Really good mascara, great for adding length and stays on really well!"

Not only is it surprisingly easy to use, but it offers you greater control too. And it's ultra-friendly on your locks, thanks to next-gen ion generator technology. By depositing millions of negative ions onto your hair, the brush closes the hair cuticle as it glides, leaving your mane frizz-free and extra glossy.",

            "Worked really well. Gave me a hairdressers blowout without the hairdresser charge",
            "I have got a medium length hair and this thermal brush doesn't do much for it. It doesn't curl it or make waves or straighten it just a simple blow dry look that doesn't last.  But that is not why I gave it 2 stars. It is way to overpriced for what it is. You get a green or red light when you put it on and that's it. It doest tell you when it has reached the desired temperature so you can just assume its ready to use. It is very basic and Its not worth the price.",
            "I didn't have high hopes for this but I was so wrong. It takes a bit of practice at first but once I got the hang of it  I loved it it's so quick and easy I have been using it every day since. It gives bouncy soft curls shape/bend perfect if like me you have layers and especially perfect if you have curtain bangs. I struggled to style mine until now this makes it so easy I'm obsessed.",

            "I am used to doing my blowouts the traditional way- with a round brush and hair dryer, so when I saw this on TikTok I was influenced! I can say that I am 100% impressed! It gives amazing results and looks sleeker than when I use the traditional method (I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair). It’s silent so I can do this in the middle of the night and not worry about disturbing my housemates. It’s also thin and lightweight which is perfect for travel. I’m surprised some reviews say it doesn’t work- if you know what you’re doing and allow it to heat up a bit before using it should work perfectly! Overall, this product is a game changer and super convenient if you love the blowout look!",
            "I have a bob and I find this this really helps to curl my ends up and give it volume. It also smooths the frizz while adding volume. It's easy to use and I really love it!"

The first of ghd’s mane-changing heroes, this wonderful device is the perfect all-rounder with the ability to create anything from sleek ‘n straight hair to boho waves.   Using improved ceramic heat technology and snag-free floating plates, these glide effortlessly through tresses to deliver the optimum temperature of 185ºC – ghd’s team of scientists concluded that cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. A round barrel allows for versatile styling, particularly when creating curls, while a staggering 30 second heat up time is a God send on busy mornings. For peace of mind, the device automatically switches off after 30 minutes and a universal voltage makes it the perfect travel companion. Good hair all day, every day? Sounds like a no-brainer to us…",

However, it does its job really well and I don't feel as if it taking up extra time. Further, I didn't feel as though my hair was being 'burnt' when using it. Overall, I really recommend this!",

            "I cannot live without my GHD's!! When my last one's broke on me (after almost 10 years) I just had to purchase some new ones. I have thick frizzy curly hair, with GHD's I have straight glossy managble hair :)",

            "Easy to use, the safety feature is such a convenient thing. I was definitely surprised - had straighteners before and was bit doubtful about buying one from ghd thinking it’s all hype but that hype has a very good reason. It’s incredibly easy to use! Thought it’s not convenient to keep it in the original box so better get some sort of case for it too."

Simply switch out with your existing shower head to save water, boost pressure and filter out unwanted metals, chlorine and impurities.  Featuring an advanced two-step filtration system powered by amino acids, activated carbon fibre and KDF 55, this clever shower head removes water-soluble metals (including lead, iron, mercury and nickel), trihalomethane (THMs) and odour. This softer water is kinder on skin and hair, and the boosted pressure makes short work of rinsing out suds for lightweight locks and happier skin.",

            "This is not for everyone, but the quality is fantastic!  The packaging is just such high quality, the shadows are so glittery and truly mesmerising!  I am so happy, I bought this. Definitely a special occasion kind of palette. I saw negative reviews, about it being too monochrome and grey!  Well, it's a cool tone palette with grey, silver, and blacks. That's what you are getting here.  I love monochromes!",
            "I’m a collector of ND palettes so I was was always going to be picking this up and the colour palette spoke to my emo youth but… The lighter shades are too similar and some of them don’t even show on my super pale skin. The dark shades have the same issue - too similar and not enough variety. The shimmers/metallics are amazing quality and the star of the show but can you guess what I’m about to say…."

After struggling to find the perfect nude for her broad clientele, often resorting to mixing various shades together to find the perfect one, Denona was compelled to create her own line of nude hues that would flatter everyone and complement her classic smoky eye looks. The result? This palette which provides the ideal new base for every skin, shade and need. Starring a range of intense pigments, from shimmers and metallics to softer mattes, it boasts pink, neutral pink and neutral beige undertones.",

This lightweight, skin-nourishing balm-to-foam texture grips any stubborn oils, dirt and debris to sweep away every last trace of the day. Fruity and refreshing, the star is papaya - a rich source of dark spot-diminishing vitamin C and cell-stimulating vitamin A - which refines as it helps to restore uniformity. The mix of exfoliating and calming papaya seed oil, papaya enzymes, papaya extract, and antioxidant-packed blueberry, leaves skin clean and bouncy. Radiance is the name of the game here, as skin is left positively glowing without so much as a sting to the eyes or a stripped, tight-feeling surface in sight. An absolute must-try, this formula is vegan, cruelty-free and free from PEGs, parabens, mineral oil, sulfates, silicones, phthalates, drying alcohols, synthetic dyes and fragrance.

        "description": "Powerful enough to do away with make up and dirt but gentle enough to use twice daily to clear pores, the Superfood Cleanser is like a fresh smoothie for your face  instantly feeding it with good-for-you ingredients thatll have you feeling refreshed and raring to go.Using cold-pressed antioxidants (make sure youre massaging the formula into skin for 30 seconds to reap their full rewards), this fresh, clean and herbaceous-smelling cleanser uses kale to pump skin with phytonutrients and vitamins C, E and K. Spinach soothes and cools while encouraging moisture retention, and green tea acts as an anti-inflammatory while keeping your skin barrier healthy with essential fatty acids. Antioxidant-rich alfalfa also makes an appearance, protecting your skin from the stress of free radicals and city living. Basically, theres nothing this cleanser cant do",

            "This is a solid cleanser. It cleanses quite well without being overly stripping. I will continue to purchase this.",
            "Its last nearly a year and cleens the face without stripping it of all the good things.",
            "Smells really good, foams well so you don't need a full pump to wash your face - it won't run out that fast. I really like it!!",
            "This works just as it says - removes makeup so easily and lathers great.\n                            Can be slightly drying so ensure you follow up with moisturiser!",
            "I only bought this a few weeks ago and I love this. I use this as a morning cleanse and it leaves my skin so clean and fresh. It never drys out my skin. I d noticed I’ve had no breakout since using this.",
            "This is hands down my favourite cleanser. I’ve got oily skin and always reach to gel cleansers but find many I have tried leave my skin feeling dry and stripped - this doesn’t do that at all. It lathers well and you don’t need to use much as it’s quite concentrated. There is a mild scent which I find pleasant and doesn’t stay on afterwards. My skin is also sensitive to fragrance but doesn’t react to this. I’m now on my 3rd bottle and will definitely be repurchasing when this bottle is finished.",
            "Absolutely amazing and so worth the price! I have been using for a year and would recommend to everybody!!",
            "One of the only cleansers which properly cleans my skin without making it feel dry and tight! Such a lovely refreshing scent as well. I always notice a difference when I use this."

        "description": "An innovative must-have for protecting porous, colour-treated hair, Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray seals each strand with an invisible waterproofing cloak - perfect for fighting frizz.  If you colour your hair, your strands are probably more porous and vulnerable to humidity - which means more risk of frizz! Introducing Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, which 'shrinkwraps' every strand with an invisible waterproofing cloak to prevent frizz and flyaways. Heat-activated, the effects of this spray last through three to four washes and work to compress, tighten and seal hair strands for a supernaturally sleek, smooth and ultra-silky finish. Unlike typical 'humidity-guard' serums, Dream Coat will not build up, weigh hair down or make it greasy - and it comes in a handbag-compatible size so you never fall foul of the weather. ",

            "I have really fine frizzy hair - I’ve got to be careful if I apply liberally as it directs then I end up with really lank greasy looking hair - so I concentrate on the worst parts like my cowslip in the front and flyaways at the part then a bit on the ends - makes it that I can survive a rainy day under the umbrella without ending up with a frizzy mess but it’s not the miracle worker advertised",

        "description": "An innovative must-have for protecting porous, colour-treated hair, Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray seals each strand with an invisible waterproofing cloak - perfect for fighting frizz.  If you colour your hair, your strands are probably more porous and vulnerable to humidity - which means more risk of frizz! Introducing Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, which 'shrinkwraps' every strand with an invisible waterproofing cloak to prevent frizz and flyaways. Heat-activated, the effects of this spray last through three to four washes and work to compress, tighten and seal hair strands for a supernaturally sleek, smooth and ultra-silky finish. Unlike typical 'humidity-guard' serums, Dream Coat will not build up, weigh hair down or make it greasy - and it comes in a handbag-compatible size so you never fall foul of the weather. ",

        "description": "Ultra-nourishing yet completely weightless, the innovative No. 7 Bonding Oil restores and renews your hair without coating it in a greasy film. Quite the contrary, expect silky smooth lengths that shine brighter than the oil itself. Formulated to rebuild the damaged disulphide bonds in your hair, the star ingredient is bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate – sounds science-y but it works to strengthen and repair damage post-colouring, bleaching or heat styling (and it even works wonders on 'virgin' hair!) Perfect as a conditioning treatment or a styling step (it protects against heat up to 450°!), this oh-so dreamy oil sinks into stressed-out tresses to make them instantly more manageable – smoothing frizz and taming flyaways in its wake. ",

            "Smells incredible, like peaches if I had to describe it! Makes my hair so smooth and silky in combination with other creams and oils, the heat protection is just a bonus. My product, on daily use, has lasted me a year! Definitely worth the price.",

            "The bottle is tiny but frankly you barely need to use much per application. It is a lightweight oil that feels nourishing and smooths the hair of frizz and flyaways. I am nervous about using too much to give an unintentional greasy look, but a couple of drops of this just slicks everything into place, whether I've opted for curly or straight.",

Each one is formulated with Ultra Medical Grade lanolin, which resembles and mimics your own skin oils to restore moisture unlike anything else and holds 200% of its weight in moisture.

Intensely hydrating, nourishing and 100% natural, this rescue ointment has 101 uses, providing immediate relief from everything from dry spots to sore cuticles and nasal passages. Dermatologically tested, this multitasking hero is vegetarian and baby friendly, cruelty-free and is free from ‘nasties’, making it an absolute no brainer. Want it to go further? Why not mix it in with your favourite daily hydrator to supercharge its skin-replenishing effects?",

            "For years I searched for a lip balm that could truly save dry and chapped lips in the winter. This is it! Nourishing and glossy. Sometimes I use it on dry cuticles too.",
            "My go to overnight lip balm and cannot be without this in my collection! Lips always feel hydrated in morning",
            "I'm big on  lip treatments, I always carry a balm in my handbag and I have various ones dotted around the house. This one however stands out because it really does lock in all the moisture and keeps my lips chap free and plump. If you're prepping before lip liner, only use a small amount as it's quite thick and glossy. Great for your night time routine.",
            "The best lip balm for dry lips!",
            "Loved this stuff for years. It is like a better a version of vaseline: it actually moisturises and lasts on the lips. Best used overnight, layer over lips at end of skin routine, wake up to plump soft lips. Not the most practical lip product to wear under makeup - need to use a lip primer or otherwise matiffy the lips to be able to apply lip liner etc as it is basically the texture of a gloss.",
            "I love this little tube of ointment, especially for the price! It’s incredibly nourishing and a little goes a long way so it lasts forever. I’ve tried multiple lip balms/masks trying to find what works best and this holds its own up against the most expensive ones I’ve bought. I’ve repurchased it multiple times and recommended it to friends and family. I mostly use it on my lips but it’s also good at moisturising stubbornly dry patches of skin. Would definitely recommend.",
            "I love this, it's unscented, deeply moisturising, quickly absorbed and non greasy.  And the tube lasts a very long time because it's so concentrated.  So concentrated that in cold weather you may need to warm it up in your hands to get it soft enough to squeeze out of the tube.",
            "Absolutely love this, used this for many years before deciding to try other lip products mainly out of boredom however this is the best multi purpose ointment and keeps lips super hydrated among nail cuticles etc, love love love! Always keep a spare in the make up bag. Also, non irritating!",

There’s ‘Green Apple’, a vitamin and antioxidant-rich formula that naturally deflects harmful environmental elements and pollutants, ‘Strawberry’, which helps to slough away dead skin cells and reveal healthy, new skin thanks to the key addition of alpha-hydroxy acids; ‘Peach’, which helps to revive skin with its combination of vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, ‘Coconutter’, which is boosted with vitamin E and is rich in antioxidants to make it ultra-hydrating and, finally, 'Watermelon', which is boosted with vitamin E and watermelon fruit extract to intensely hydrate. Each one is formulated with Ultra Medical Grade lanolin, which resembles and mimics your own skin oils to restore moisture unlike anything else and holds 200% of its weight in moisture. Vegetarian, baby-friendly and free from any nasties, this is basically a no brainer! ",

            "I have used this product from some years, it has a lovely smell and feels good. Not sure it makes a huge difference, though, but I have persevered. However, the last 3 bottles I have bought (not all from Cult Beauty) fragmented around the top, leaving tiny shards of glass in the oil.Not the best thing to happen in an oil intended for close to the eyes.",
            "I have bought this item many times, and it does help with sparse eyebrows.\n\n                            However, the last 3 times I have purchased it the top of the bottle has fragmented at first use, making it hard to use after the first time. And dangerous, with bits of broken glass near the eyes.",
            "Put the brows in place sure, but the applicator took up too much product which in the long run made it only last for a month",
            "This smells amazing and the applicator is a brilliant idea. Can't vouch for any beneficial claims as half the contents leaked out of the bottle. Don't understand how as it wasn't cracked anywhere. For £35 for a tiny amount, it wasn't the best use of my money.",
            "I thought I’d use the lockdown to grow out my brows so I treated myself to this oil. The oil smells delicious but that is about it. \n                             I’ve used this for about 4 weeks now, everyday and used half of the bottle. I haven’t seen any growth or additional fullness in my brows. I’m going to use the full bottle but I’m not filled with much expectation.",
            "I started using the treatment 2 weeks ago, l am enjoying it so far but the packaging is extremely bad, because it keeps leaking and wasting expensive product! And because of that I’m almost half way through the bottle.\n                             I’m extremely unsatisfied because I can’t enjoy this good product.",
            "In the beginning, I was like no way I'm paying so much for a silly brow oil :-) I'm hooked now. I'm sure it's not my wishful thinking - my brows do seem to be fuller now, and the right one that was overplucked and visibly thinner than the left one is getting fuller again. It'll take more time, but at least I've got a product that seems to actually really truly work. Sorry, Uma that I doubted you :-)",
            "Similar to other reviews, I felt it was a lot of money for a smidge of the product but I am SO buying another. No exaggeration, it is unbelievable. I've used lockdown to grow out my scarce brows back into the caterpillars I once got bullied for. And with the help of this oil, they have never looked better. I am so much confident with my brows now, I’ve decided to grow out my fringe. I no longer pencil-in gaps or use brow",
            "I was really skeptical when I bought this but figured I'd give it a go. I was initially livid how small the bottle is as well, but let me tell you, this stuff is amazing. I've been using it for about 6 weeks and I've had so much new growth and my eyebrows looks thicker and fuller than ever. I'm really impressed with the results and am buying my second bottle now :)"

Along with a wash of sheer colour, each scent is also infused with a unique nourishing fruit extract. Choose from ‘Strawberry’, which delivers a pretty red tint and vitamin C-packed strawberry extract; ‘Watermelon’, a pink-ish tint completed with watermelon extract; or ‘Cherry’, a berry-hued shade charged with antioxidant-rich cherry extracts.",

A handbag essential if ever we saw one…  The star of the show here is, of course, lanolin, which envelops lips in moisture, leaving them soft and oh-so-kissable. Along with a wash of sheer colour, each scent is also infused with a unique nourishing fruit extract. Choose from ‘Strawberry’, which delivers a pretty red tint and vitamin C-packed strawberry extract; ‘Watermelon’, a pink-ish tint completed with watermelon extract; or ‘Cherry’, a berry-hued shade charged with antioxidant-rich cherry extracts.",

        "description": "The secret to a perfect pout, Charlotte Tilbury's Lip Cheat has a super-smooth, snag-free formula and is packed with long-wear pigment to create an even lip line and prevent lip colour 'bleeding'. Ultra-easy to apply and available in a spectrum of shades (there's one to complement each of Charlotte Tilbury's lipstick hues), these multi-purpose pencils can be used to outline, prime or 'fill in' lips for foolproof, kiss-resistant lip enhancement that won't smudge or feather as the days wears on. So, whether you favourite the 90s' inspired 'Foxy Brown' (warm, cafac au lait), the perfect 'your lips but better' nude 'Pillow Talk Original', rich, flattering red 'Walk of No Shame' (formerly known as 'Walk of Shame'), natural berry 'M.I.KISS' (formerly known as 'Bond Girl') or the stunning, old-Hollywood scarlet of 'So Red' (formerly known as 'So Marilyn), equip yourself with several of these crayons to ensure your lip look in 'on point'.",

        "description": "A lash and brow treatment serum with a difference — Augustinus Bader’s latest innovative creation works to support your hair growth cycle through a unique concoction of heavily-researched, nourishing and stimulating actives of the highest quality. Would you expect anything less?  The latest innovation to come forth from the skin and hair-changing ranks of this indulgent range is The Eyebrow & Lash Enhancing Serum. Created to lock in moisture, prevent damage and support cellular renewal, this is clinically proven to bring about fuller, thicker brows and lashes. No Augustinus Bader formulation would be complete without the patented complex of amino acids, high-grade vitamins and synthesised molecules that make up the unique TFC8 active ingredient. Used daily, this helps to guide key nutrients to the skin cells and create an optimal environment for your body’s innate repair and renewal processes to thrive. Where would any hair-boosting product be without a dose of biotin, this hair hero helps to metabolise amino acids and boost keratin production for overall healthier, stronger hairs. Finally, a trio of red winter algae, peptide-rich tumeric and hyaluronic acid work to improve hair density, prevent shedding and create a protective moisture barrier around the hair shaft for revived, thicker and healthier brows and lashes.

        "reviews": [
            "For comparison, I previously used Latisse for over 10 years then changed to Revitalash for 2 years. I enjoyed excellent results from both of those products with both length and volume added to my naturally sparse lashes. \n\n                            I have now used the Bader lash serum since May, so approximately 4 months of consistent use morning and night. The advantage to the Bader would be no \"drug\" ingredients, a cleaner formula. But the disadvantage is that is doesn´t work as well as either Latisse or Revitalash for me. My lashes have maintained some volume but the length is gone. However they are healthy and not falling out. For the price point the results are not super, but if you want a break from Revitalash and are ready to spend the same amount of money, you could try the Bader. But I think you probably could get similar results from using castor oil. \n                            TBH The only Bader product that I would consider repurchasing would be the BaderxVictoria Beckham serum, the rest of the line has not given me the results that I would expect at this price point.",
            "Unfortunately, this gave me irritated and swollen eyes so I had to stop using.",
            "I have previously used Revitalash and had good results on the lashes but not the brows. I have now used these consistently twice a day for over 3 months. I have noticed no difference to my brows, and my lashes seem to have maintained the decent length I had with Revitalash, but not improved. \n\n                            Positive it that it doesn't seem to have made my eyelids pink. Downside is I might have expected more impact for the price! Also the product leaks inside the lid and dries up, annoying when you pay this much per ml.",
            "I applied this consistently to my brows for 2 and half months, morning and night. I can confirm they definitely got thicker so I was pleased with the results despite the high price of the product. I had to stop applying because of my skin reacting to hay fever and pollen but will restart in fall.",
            "This product slowly improved my eyebrow thickness and evenness. Very chic packaging",
            "I have tried a few serums and this is one of the best. Better than revitalash. I noticed a difference in a few days. Would buy again although it is expensive",
            "I have tried other serums before but I have sensitive eyes and they made my eyes water. This serum is very good in that it does not affect my eyes. I have been using it for about a week and I’m sure I can see a slight improvement in the thickness of my eyebrows",
            "So far I am seeing an improvement in the quality of my brows in particular.Early days but this products is worth trying.",
            "This has made a real difference to the fullness of my brows, my lashes are also longer, would definitely recommend.",
            "Will buy this again I have noticed such a huge difference to my lashes , can’t really tell on my brows, but thrilled with my lashes"

I've tried it with cleansing balm and micellar water, but literally my entire eye area becomes black and I have to wash it twice or thrice with the normal cleanser afterwards to remove the entire thing off my face. \n                            it is soo good but can be annoying when removing it. So i have a love hate relationship with this. \n                            I've had this for more than a year now and i still have a lot left but it has slightly dried up though",

            "This is probably the worst eyeliner I've used - and at 18 pounds? Shocking! It smudges like nothing, moves, doesn't hold... I've used drugstore liners that hold longer than this.  I've been using it for a week, it keeps smudging and at the end of my working day it's almost completely off.  I do use primer and even tried giving it a light dusting of setting powder.  Terrible stuff, I regret this purchase and it's not cheap!",

        "description": "Fun fact: Danessa Myricks Beauty spent two years making the Groundwork Palette - a first-of-its-kind palette designed to sculpt and shape the face. It's safe to say this is an every day, all-over face essential. Brimming with curated neutral shades which are suitable for all skin tones and the eyes and face, each colour boasts two unique textures. The first texture? A high-performance, lightweight cream that applies with ease, then there are the powders in coordinating tones, infused with upsalite for oil control. So whether you want to shape and define brows, highlight the brow bone, line and blend out the lower lash line, add a wash of colour to the lid, this buildable palette creates soft to bold results with a velvet, satin finish.",
        "reviews": [
            "Why have different palettes for your eyes, cheeks, lips and face when you can have one? This multi-use collection features a beautiful range of neutrals (with each shade in two textures) that can be used on all your features. I found that each colour is buildable too, so you can make your look as subtle or as bold as you like! I’m more than impressed.",
            "As someone who is quite frankly a bit scared of eyeshadow, this palette is perfect for any first time shadow users! Not only are the shadows neutral (which is perfect for the everyday) they can be used on your face, brows and eyes so you will def get your wear out of it regardless if you don't use eyeshadows that much! P.s. I love creating faux-freckles with it.",
            "First things first, can we appreciate this beautiful palette’s packaging! I’m sold already. It makes for the perfect gift and will sit perfectly on everyone’s vanity desk. And as for the actual product, that’s just as impressive. Not only are the shades perfect for a neutral devotee like me, but each pigment is powerful, tac-free and applies seamlessly. Ideal for sculpting your face, defining your brows and making your eyes and lips pop – this palette really does it all. Let’s just say if I was stuck on a desert island and I could only take once piece of make up, it would be this!",
            "Great palette with gorgeous neutrals! The formulas are easy to use and blend. The palette itself is very well made and packaging feels very luxurious!",
            "I understand this is multi purpose but it doesn’t work very well on the face as contour or bronzer. It works really well for my eyebrows but the powder size pan is way too small to uses and a proper eyeshadow and the crème putty formula doesn’t work very well on the eyes. Cool product but not executed very well unless you want a full palette of eyebrow pomade and powder😫",
            "This is a lovely palette and a great concept. The only thing I would change is the powder pan being bigger.",
            "I think this is a really good concept where you can use the pomade and then set with the powder. I took one star off as I would prefer the powder pan to be bigger.",
            "Packaging is fabulous, texture seems goof for all over the face , cant wait to experiment more",
            "I love Danessa but this palette is a huge miss. From white fibres on the palette, to how bad it smells, how patchy it applies and not user friendly at all! I'm a trained mua and struggled so much with this!  I own so many of her other products and love them but this one is an expensive flop. Dissapointed is an understatement, as I was so excited for this release. Sorry!"

The formula of Ka-Brow was perfect, this formula is TOO creamy and pigmented and made my brows look blocky, maybe I’m using it wrong but it’s currently sat at the back of my makeup draw. I can’t see me reaching for this again. If you’re looking for a Ka-Brow replacement, this is not it!"

        "description": "Made specially for use with the brand's Brow Freeze (which swiftly took the beautysphere by hurtling storm), the dual-ended Brow Freeze Applicator boasts a unique spatula on one side with a perfectly-sized spoolie on the other.When dealing with brow styling wax, the last thing you want is for things to get messy, which is why the Brow Freeze Applicator's metal spatula is so useful. Allowing you to easily scoop out your desired amount (tip: a little goes a long way), use the tool like a palette knife – offloading product onto your palette before going in with your spoolie brush. Giving you complete control over how much product you use and where exactly you use it – reducing the chance of clumping or uneven application – the spoolie end is precise and easy to use, working to lift, tame, shape, sculpt and feather every brow hair and evenly distributing product throughout your arch. This is where the spatula end comes back into its own: you can use it to press down each hair – flattening your look in place for long-lasting and extreme hold – whether your hairs are thick, coarse, curly, downward-growing or sparse. Cue everyone asking: 'Brow on earth do you do it?'",
        "reviews": [
            "It’s a ‘nice to have’ vs. a must have, wouldn’t say it’s worth the money.  You’re paying for the spatula but can easily use the product without.

            "Love that the brush has two sides, the spoolie side for brushing out hairs when u apply the wax whereas the spatula side helps to smooth the hairs down to stay in place",

I have thick eyebrow hairs and it holds them in place all day, this is the first eyebrow gel that’s done that for me. It’s quick and easy and it will be a new stable in my makeup bag",
            "It’s ok but I prefer some of my other brow gels. I like the brush and it does keep the brows in place but can flake during the day and leaves the brows feeling a bit stiff and crunchy",
            "i love the applicator on this and it works well but i do think you can get an alternative brow gel for cheaper to do the same thing \n                            love but probably won’t repurchase"

        "reviews": [
            "Can’t get over how much I love this! I have very sparse, but long brow hairs and finding products to fill the gaps is a nightmare. Not only does this fill the gaps naturally, I can build it up depending on whether I want my brows to stand out more. It gives that weird natural but obviously something there ‘look.’ So easy to use as well, just pair it with angled brow brush. I tend to set it with the brow pomade, but if you have shorter hairs than me you might not need anything.",
            "Great colour and easy to use and apply, lasts all day, love it",
            "The best brow powder I have used ! Perfect with an angled brush. Sits nicely over brows and stays on all day.",
            "Based on the promo pics I was afraid that the cool fair will be too yellow in reality it is a nice cool toned one, pretty pigmented so little goes a long way. Very pleased with this purchase.",
            "Really no complaints. Love the packaging, highly pigmented and does last well throughout the day. \n\n                            Easy to apply; makes doing my brows sooo much quicker. It's definitely going to last as well so it's so worth the money. \n\n                            Shade 4.5 is perfect for me, I have very dark but very cool toned brows and it's spot on.",
            "First time trying this. I have exceptionally sparse eyebrows due to over plucking in my teenage years. I also have scarring from microblading, so nothing has properly filled them in. This however is exactly what I always needed in m life !"

            "It was too dark for me, but I know it is a great product. Just struggling to find the right colour.",
            "My fave brow powder. Tried a lot and nothing comes close to the finish I get from this",
            "You can't get better than ABH, this stuff lasts for YEARS and it has incredible staying power through the day. I don't know how they made such a fantastic product. I used to use the ABH dipbrow pomade but switched to this a few years ago when lighter brows became more fashionable. This is my second purchase of this product, the first being about 4 years ago, it lasted that long!",

Perfect used to prep and prime brows, the all-in-one clear gel suits all hair colours and is delivered via a soft-touch applicator for effortless wielding and seamless application. Twist the base and glide over brows for a beauty boost – it will enhance and extend the wear of any eyebrow products that follow. As if that wasn’t enough, the keratin and soy protein-enriched formula conditions and smooths eyebrow hairs, helping to tame unruly arches and make them thicker, healthier and fuller. For the ultimate conditioning treat, wear a layer of the nutrient-rich formula while you snooze – it’s like an overnight hair mask for your brows.",

I love how easy it is to use, and it’s definitely made my brows softer and they just generally look healthier. It’s staying a part of my daily routine, and I’ll definitely buy again.",

            "I have slightly sparse brows which are thinner than I'd like due to overplucking in my younger years! I was hoping for this primer to give my brows more body, but instead it just seemed to lightly fluff them up. I wasn't exactly expecting huge dramatic results, but I'd *hoped* for a little bit more than what seems like a lightweight version of the Benefit 24hr Clear Brow Setting Gel - which I love, incidentally. Well, for me it's back to using the other Benefit brow products, the wonderful Precisely pencil, Brow Gel, and the aforementioned setting gel whilst I again consider microblading. I probably won't be getting this primer again though.",
            "I've started using this product after a brow catastrophe. The brows are now growing fuller, and I intend to keep using it for a while.",

            "This is an instant favourite from me. Not only does this lip oil deliver a coat of subtle colour to lips (I’ve got shade ‘dream’ which might look intimidating but it’s perfect!) but thanks to the infusion of jojoba oil and hyaluronic acid, this lightweight formula is intensely nourishing. The restorative powers don’t go unnoticed too! You now won't find me without this.",

            "It’s a nice colour and great shiny moisturising formula, you can feel it on your lips for ages and it’s not sticky, even after drinking,,, However, it doesn’t smell great: smells like oils which just means there’s no fragrance and it’s a natural scent. But it’s not my favourite as you can kind of taste it a bit after applying too, but it does go away so i don’t mind. I wanna get more colours now, super easy for everyday shiny lips. I wish the applicator dispensed more product in one go, but it’s fine to dip in again.",
            "So its not as oily as what i would like. It’s definitely more of a glossy feel than an oil. Still really hydrating and beautiful shades. The only thing is i would of loved a scent personally."

            "I bought this for a gift for a young lady that was interested in trialling Charlottes products but couldn’t justify the £s herself - she was over the moon to finally try the pillow talk range",
            "I was a bit skeptical as my first experience with CT was with foundation and filter and was a complete disaster . Anyway after a few years I wanted to try the pillow talk range in order to test quality of eye/ lip pencil and the wand … and oh boy … love it !  Pencils are super creamy and stay doesn’t have this waxy texture as others . The wand is … amazing so easy and looks stunning even without foundation on  . after this would def buy full size products .  Lovely smell too . Forgot to say lipstick is divine ."

            "The smell of this perfume I received a miniature and decided to buy a bigger version. Bonus this came with oil and mask to try",
            "Such a fab gift set. I can’t wait to see my teenaged daughters face on Xmas morning.",
            "Great set if you want to try out before buying the full size. The mask is really small but did leave my hair feeling soft. I love the smell of the hair perfume and will definitely repurchase. The hair oil is leaves my hair looking shiny, be careful to not use too much hair oil as can leave hair looking greasy",
            "im in love with the gisou products and thats the perfect chance to gift nice products to close people",

            "A nice gift set for a Gisou lover, but the box was smaller than what I was expecting.",
            "I like the smell of the product besides that I don't really feel any change in my hair or any improvement... just a good smell other than that I wasn't enthusiastic",
            "It’s great opportunity to try new hype products from Gisou. Wonderful set and amazing scent",
            "I love the scent on the gisou products (minus the leave in conditioner) they smell amazing. This little box is well worth the price. Apart from the mask (which is tiny) they’re all good sized products and worth a try.",
            "I have fine straight hair but prone to frizzzz! The oil is lush but you need the smallest amount ever or it’ll just look greasy on finer hair. The hair perfume is to die for I am in love!"

Unlike so many others, this is totally, honestly, completely kiss-proof and offers hours of gorgeous, face-flattering wear. The sheer liquid formulation glides onto skin to give an instantly uplifting wash of colour – it’s fabulous on faces and luscious on lips and can be applied with the brush-tipped lid for an ultra-natural, rosy flush. Subtle yet sexy and scented with a gorgeous, delicate rose fragrance, it bestows the ultimate healthy glow wherever it’s applied. Available in full (10ml) and travel (6ml) sizes, this multitasking marvel is a mainstay in our make up bags.",

            "I used to use this in my early 20s and it's always been a staple in my makeup bag. Now my 13 year old daughter wants to experiment with makeup but I'd rather she didn't look like she's caked it on, and this is the ideal solution. A tint that looks entirely natural when on, an applicator brush that's simple to use and means she doesn't need brushes that I'll have to nag her to keep clean. This one I bought for her 13th birthday and I like the idea of getting it for her every year as a tradition, as it'll really take that long for her to use it up.",

I blend it in with a foundation brush and it gives a very flawless finish to my makeup. \n                            I’ve got olive skin and it really compliments my complexion.",
            "This product is so nice on my lips- it has a great, builds me colour and also smells like roses! I wish it lasted a bit longer, but I really do like it a lot, and it has become my new go to lip colour.",
            "I love this stain, perfect for a hint of tint during the day, or go for three layers for a subtle look in the evening. A little goes a long way on the cheek - just a drop on each side is enough for a dewy, flushed spring beauty look.",

Allowing you to achieve a precise and defined outline draw just outside your natural lip-line to subtly augment before filling in the long-wear, creamy pigment enhances lips without smudging or budging; staying put by the pool, in the rain and under masks! Effortlessly applying like butter and soothing lips with its velvet-matte texture, a nourishing complex of soybean and liquorice ensures lips are left feeling plump and comfortable. The twist-up bullet makes application a breeze, and the Contour comes in 12 inclusive shades from Sandy Beige (a fool-proof nude) to Universal Red (a show-stopping scarlet) and everything in between.

            "I recently purchased a lip balm and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed. \n\n                            One of the things I love most about this lip balm is its subtle yet delightful scent. It's not overpowering and it leaves my lips feeling fresh and invigorated.\n\n                            But what really sets this lip balm apart is its ability to add volume to my lips. I've tried countless lip balms in the past and none have been able to deliver the same results. My lips look and feel plump, hydrated and healthy.\n\n                            And last but not least, the pigment is amazing. It goes on smoothly and evenly, and provides just the right amount of color to make my lips look their best. The color is long lasting and it doesn't fade or smudge easily.\n\n                            Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this lip balm and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality product that delivers real results.",
            "Having finished my previous Chantecaille Lip Potion, I then returned to numerous samples of lip gels & creams etc. but none offered the same degree of nourishment, comfort and longevity - so I have repurchased and will never be without Lip Potion because the ingredients and texture are brilliant and my lips never feel dry or taut using it.",
            "Chantecaille is one of my favourite brands, so I was psyched to try this. Honestly, though, this is just not a good item. The product is really loose and a little messy, the 'delicate pink sheen' it's supposed to leave behind is really nothing noteworthy, and the scent is rose-like but not very pleasing? The price is insane for the amount of product, but I thought it would be worth it? I was wrong! \n                             \n\n                             TLDR: not worth it, get the Fresh rose lip cream instead for half the price"

Combining soft powders and hyaluronic filling spheres, these innovative velvety lip cremes create colour and comfort that lasts all day.  In a liquified formula that never feels drying, these Silky Lip Cremes wrap lips in softening esters and emollients to help lock in moisture. Advanced silicone elastomers, plumping hyaluronic and soft powder pigments smooth the skin's surface to make lips appear plumped up, while a clever flexible cross polymer blend ensures your lip look never cracks, bleeds or smudges. Be warned, this irresistible formula comes in five stunning neutral shades - from the cocoa-hued 'Complicated' to the rose-tinted 'Flushed' - and you're sure to want them all. ",

            "Perfect for brows. Keeps them looking fluffy. Great price. Highly recommend.",
            "First of all, let me say if you are looking for a product to laminate your brows, this is not it. However, this does hold your brows in place and is great for a more uniformed/styled brow. It does not make the hairs feel sticky or crispy, it actually keeps them looking fluffy. If I am creating a strong brow, I will apply this as the last step to hold it in place. If I want a more natural brow, I will apply this first and then go in with a brow pen/pencil to fill in any gaps. I will definitely be reaching for this a lot!",
            "I love Nudestix. They continue to come out with really easy to use, efficacious products. The spoolie is great for separating brows and the gel gives a nice hold. I pop this on and follow up with my hourglass brow pencil. I'm left with light and fluffy (I hope) brows that stay put. There is a slight crisp (only slight) hence the name gel but if I find this texture holds my brows in place for longer. This isn't for someone who wants a laminated brow but if you like something a little more natural this one is for you. It's too early to comment on the boosting aspect but I have no doubt the peptides will work their magic in no time.",
            "This will absolutely hold your brows in place! The brush is terrible though, use a different spoolie for best results!"

        "description": "Going far beyond traditional formulations, Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer is prepping perfection. A state-of-the-art formulation, this not only creates a smooth, even canvas for make up, it also conceals redness, minimises the appearance of pores and fine lines, prolongs the staying power of anything you apply after it and even 'waterproofs' make up! By repelling water, this ingenious formula will ensure that your make up can withstand even the most extreme weather (or emotions!). With a silky, cloud-like texture, it glides on smoothly, enhancing skin without adding weight or greasiness.Oil-free, its suitable for sensitive and blemish-prone skin and contains SPF 15 protection to shield your complexion from the suns damaging rays. If you're looking for bridal make up, this is the perfect primer for your big day (or any big day you've got coming up, for that matter...)",

            "This is such an amazing texture, I don't know how I ever done my makeup without it! Makes my skin feel so hydrated and silky and allows my makeup to apply flawlessly!",

            "This is probably my 10th bottle if not more of this prime. I swear by it and wouldn't use anything else.\n\n                            I have oily skin and large pores. This smooths out my pores and keeps my foundation oil free and it doesn't separate! \n\n                            It's expensive but it really does last AGES!",
            "Lovely primer. Very mineral based so if that’s not your vibe it’s not for you. It’s so blurring!",
            "This felt lovely on my face and makeup sat great on top.\n                            I would not purchase again due to the price and the fact that I can get the same results with more reasonably priced products.",
            "Bought the mini size. Lovely feel on the skin, my skin gets very oily so this works perfectly in helping my makeup last longer",
            "I didn't love the texture and found it didn't sit well on my slightly oily skin. Perhaps better suited to dryer skin. I actually ordered in error (I wanted the other hourglas primer, which I love!).",
            "I just recently bought this along with the setting spray. I absolutely love the glow it gives, it really does tone down my redness which I have a lot around my chin and to know it has an spf just makes it even better.

Simply placed on the eyelid or below the eye, this super-convenient little black gadget isolates the lash line, so that you can go all out with line lengthening and not worry for a moment about flecks or smears. Easy to use and clean, this make up artist favourite will shield your carefully crafted eye make up (as well as your naked lid if you’re going au naturel) and save you from painstakingly removing and touching up those inevitable smudges. You won’t know what you did without it. ",

            "I bought this, thinking it would be super useful, but tbh, I have hardly used it. Maybe it'll be more useful as I hit old age... 😅",
            "I tried to use the product once I don’t adapt. Until now I didn’t like the products.",
            "When I saw this I was really excited, I mean who hasn't ruined their eyeshadow by getting mascara all over it? I thought it was one of those inventions which once you see it is really obvious and you wonder why they aren't everywhere, but I've still never seen anything like it. Unfortunately the three stars were mainly for the idea, the lash guard itself is very rigid thick plastic, so really it's simpler using a piece of folded paper in a similar way. I kept wishing that the bottom part was made of thin silicone or something a bit softer and grippy so you don't have to concentrate on keeping it still and can focus on getting the mascara look you want. Great idea, but back to the drawing board and on to mark 2 I think!",
            "This really is rubbish. The plastic is too thick, so it doesn't sit under bottom lashes properly. It seems to be the wrong shape for the lid and is totally inflexible, so lashes at either end are caught under it. And you need to be a contortionist to be able to hold it upside down to do your lid lashes. A total waste of money and will be going on the bin.",

What’s more, the lash glue dries to a clear line so even if you need to peel off your lashes it won’t affect your eyeshadow artistry. If that wasn’t enough, the latex-free, ophthalmologically tested formula is designed with even the most sensitive eyes in mind.  ",

Please please please go back to the old formula",

I feel that it tugs at the skin when applied, and then throughout the day it makes my eyes feel drier & drier. \n                            I will use up this one but I think there's definitely better options on the market right now (ie.: the 19/99 multi-use pencils or the Make Up For Ever artist color pencils, also multi-use).",
            "it's a beautiful creamy eye pencil. It glides on smooth and easy.  love it.",
            "Lots of pigment and glides onto my lips. Matches the blur lipstick amazingly! Matches my lip colour and lasts",
            "Such a great colour on blue eyes. Easily blends for a smudged out look and lasts all day. Great texture and no tugging on skin.",
            "I like the colour and it goes well with hazel eyes. Good for blending as the pencil is not hard.",
            "Was slightly difficult at first as I don't usually use eye pencil but once you figure it out it works well. Beautiful colour and has good staying power.",
            "I usually use black eyeliner, but this red one looked so beautiful, so I decided to give it a try. I have brown eyes and it looks so beautiful! Very happy with it."

            "This powder caked no matter how much I prepped my skin or the technique I applied it with. It looked really chalky on my skin too.",
            "What an amazing powder. \n                            Ages 29. It sits so nicely and no creasing. It’s so fabulous.",
            "When I heard a pressed version of the easy bake powder was being released I was ecstatic! I've been using this powder exclusively for the last three years and adding the pressed version to my routine did not disappoint! I picked up the shad Banana Bread and it's so brightening which I love for the under eye. My only complaint is that the formula is a little drying so moving forward I know to use a little less product for my skin type",
            "Very nice product, blends like a dream and looks like skin",
            "Good powder, definitely different from the loose powder. Still, it is beautiful",
            "I love the loose Huda powder so had to try this one. It really does create a flawless finish",
            "My under eyes looked way too pale and dead, it also caked up a lot. I prefer the translucent formula much more",
            "THIS IS AMAZING!!! \n                            The brightness it gave under my eyes and the way it just set my makeup in place and did not budge!! Highly recommend it",
            "I love the loose powder version aswell , wear both together gor a flawless finish",
            "I love Huda Beauty and bought the cherry blossom loose powder as soon as I could, the hype and all that but it’s good. Really good. So when I saw the pressed I was excited. I did go back and forward about the cupcake or cherry blossom as I had heard the pressed carries more pigment with it to make it medium coverage. But I am very pale with blue veins and make up often looks yellow/orange I have lost count of the money wasted on the lightest shades that are not pale they are yellow. But with the pressed powder I realised it’s cherry blossom and it does NOT disappoint. This powder truly makes me glow from within I can use a pressed powder for the first time and I can carry it in my bag. It’s a step up from loose powder with the glow/enhanced look after application and the pigment in cherry blossom makes me look human and alive! \n                            If your palest pale skin colour you need this powder in both the loose and pressed both have a place in my routine.

This powder truly makes me glow from within I can use a pressed powder for the first time and I can carry it in my bag. It’s a step up from loose powder with the glow/enhanced look after application and the pigment in cherry blossom makes me look human and alive! \n                            If your palest pale skin colour you need this powder in both the loose and pressed both have a place in my routine. Huda Beauty truly is a great brand"

It's really light and my skin is happy with it. I used Nars tinted moisturiser for ages, but I've switched to this now. It feels better on my sensitive skin and the spf 50 is a bonus.

            "This took me awhile to get used to, but I really like it now. It gives decent coverage without being heavy and great for layering- it doesn't pill. It's not moisturising at all and can cling to dry patches, but I love that I don't get oily with this and a good moisturiser underneath helps combat any dryness. It's really light and my skin is happy with it. I used Nars tinted moisturiser for ages, but I've switched to this now. It feels better on my sensitive skin and the spf 50 is a bonus. Shade V2 is a good match for me (I'm typically Norwich/Alaska in Nars Tinted Moisturiser).",

Each of the four designs were created to fulfil every need in Nikki's kit and personal make up bag, ultimately delivering the ultimate lash wardrobe. Nikki carefully and thoughtfully designed each style to ensure that everyone could instantly create any lash look, no matter your eye shape. The Sweed X Nikki Wolff No Lash Lash set features ultra-delicate lashes in four different lengths to achieve the most natural and defined finish. Use the shorter lengths to add discrete volume along the entire lash line, or apply the longer lengths at the outer corner of your eyes to enhance your eye shape. Ideal for seasoned and skilled lash-wearers, these delicate lashes might take a moment to get the swing of, but hang in there - the results are worth it!",

            "At be it’s me, but this lovely little product is just too delicate for my heavy hands. I can tell it’s good, but it’s not user friendly.",
            "Quite fiddly for a first-timer with eyelashes, but they're so natural looking and love them on a night out.",
            "The Lashes are super pretty but most of the clusters completely fell apart getting them out of the pack, even being very careful with them.",
            "These lashes are nice when you manage to put them on, but they fall apart pretty easily. Personally, I’d not get them again. However, they do look nice.",
            "The Lashes are really delicate. It's not necessarily the worst thing but it makes them fairly tricky to work with for me.",
            "Easy to apply, even for beginners. Subtle not too heavy",
            "I have high hope for this. Sadly the lashes quiet fragile",
            "Read all the reviews & was wary but took a punt as they were on offer. They definitely are tricky to remove from the packaging but you do get in the swing of it after trashing a few! They were very delicate & so were more fiddly than others I’ve used so wouldn’t recommend them when you’re in a rush or if you tend to be heavy-handed. I very much doubt they could be reused so not great value if that’s something that’s important to you. Despite all this, they looked so beautiful once applied. Incredibly natural. To the point that when I was removing them I didn’t know which were my real lashes & which were the falsies! Would probably repurchase but wouldn’t recommend if you aren’t prepared to take your time over your lashes.",
            "These are the only false lashes I use now, so natural but can be pushed to create a more dramatic look easily. I find them easy to use, just have to make sure you remove them from the packaging correctly and there’s no issue with breakage",
            "They are natural, however, I should have trusted other reviews. They are too fragile, I’ve wasted at least 50% of that box because they just fall apart when you try to take them out of the box. I don’t know how they approved this product … How come no one tested this? It was a waste of money for sure. Yes, they are natural, but you will waste most of the box, and forget about reusing them … that’s not possible. I would love to return this, but unfortunately, I’ve used them. I wouldn’t recommend this product."

            "I stupidly bought this without checking the ingredients, something I normally always do since suffering with rosacea as one of the most common irritants is alcohol. As it was being actively marketed to treat the symptoms I presumed it would not contain any. My mistake, all three have it and within 3 days my face was red, irritated and and sore. For anyone suffering with rosacea try using alcohol free products as that has been the key to getting my redness under control. I have given the product 2 stars because it did cover the redness well and initially I was pleased with it so if you don’t have sensitivity to alcohol then it is good.",
            "An amazing  product  and  amazing  price  to try it I love it so much  put it whit a highlighter and your face  will glow",
            "The products are quite soothing and this is a nice trial set. The color correcting treatment is not for people of color though. I am a bit on the fairer side and I still found that it would give a white cast and not blend in.",
            "I have struggled with redness on my face for years and I have finally found a way to not have to wear foundation or concealer to cover it up. I warmed it on the back of my hand and pressed it into the redness on my face, the colour blends in perfectly, I'm so surprised and you can't tell I have anything on my face, looks so natural! I don't know how it will wear throughout the day but I will bring it wherever I go in case I need to top up a little. And note that you only need the smallest amount.\n                            I am yet to try the serum and cream out of the kit.",
            "I absolutely love Dr Jart. The Tiger grass colour correcting treatment is the best and last for ages(a little goes a long way) I suffer with a little redness and this makes my skin glow. You can wear it alone or under foundation as a base. The other cream and serum are also amazing. Great set and real value for money!",
            "I loved the trial kit, especially the tiger grass treatment, it really helps with redness.",
            "This product is absolutely brilliant for covering up Rosacea",
            "I have rosacea and it can be hard to neutralise the redness but everything in this mini kit is amazing and I’ll definitely be buying the full sized versions now!",
            "Great Kit for testing out the products or traveling with. Not sure that the colour correct is for me because I scar purple or brown not red.",
            "This might be the best product I’ve ever used on my skin. Once applied to my skin, within minutes I looked radiant, younger, glowing and flawless. If you like a natural make up look, this is perfect, can easily wear on its own. Would highly highly recommend this product"

It's really light and my skin is happy with it. I used Nars tinted moisturiser for ages, but I've switched to this now. It feels better on my sensitive skin and the spf 50 is a bonus.

Blurring the under-eye area, it dials up the brightness while decreasing coverage — and it’s crease, sweat and transfer-proof.  Infused with a brightening cocktail of actives, this creamy yet sheer formula features vitamin C and niacinamide to soften pigmentation and boost luminosity (no dark circles here). Choose between five juicy shades, from 'Pink Pomelo' to 'Blood Orange' — then wait for everyone to ask what your secret is. We told you it was magic!",

It can be used without concealer as well. It matches my skin tone really well when blended (it has a thin, creamy texture so easy to blend). Tried a lot of colour correctors and this is the best one I’ve tried. Lasts all day and doesn’t crease once you set it with powder. I really love Huda Beauty products.",
            "I have used colour correctors under my eyes for decades now and this one is the best. I have VERY dark undereyes and very pale skin, which presents me a big problem when concealing, meaning I inevitably have to use a colour corrector and a concealer. This product has enough pigment to really correct the blue - purple of my undereyes, whilst remaining thin enough so that my concealer does not look cakey when applied over the top. This product whilst not being especially moisturising, isn't particularly drying. I have found my holy grail at last!",
            "I was originally using this in a darker shade. It worked really well but the orangey shade kept coming through. Recently watched a Huda Beauty video and switched to the peach one and it’s a match made in heaven. This has got to be the best colour corrector!",
            "The colour I fit was all went for me. Way too dark, but I bought the pinky one and it does what it says, it corrected my skin tone. My concealer does look better over the top of this rather than on its own. You don’t need a lot on though!",
            "I cautiously dotted the colour corrector around my under-eye socket, then blended it. It wasn't super thick. I then dotted over the Huda concealer, which I also blended with a brush. I then spritzed with my usual setting spray. I had excellent coverage. It stayed on throughout the day. I did have to experiment with the shades though. I first bought the Peach, which was a touch too dark for my medium light skin tone which tans easily. I purchased the Pink Pomelo and I think it will suit me best for going into the autumn / winter months.",

            "This is my 3rd tube of this, i think that says enough!",
            "I have used this for years and years and can’t be without it. I have tried the odd product from other brands but nothing compares to this. I get really oily eyelids and can not keep any make up on my eyes without this. Mattifies the eyelid and my make up does not budge until I take it off. Would 100% recommend!"

Long lasting and great pigment, but I'll probably stick to NYX in the future.",

        "description": "Anastasia's Brow Wiz is an ultra fine pencil designed to shape, fill and 'plump out' sparse or unshapely brows. It avoids the 'coloured in' look using a skinny, mechanical nib that can mimic even the finest hairs, coupled with a brush for convenient blending. You can fake fuller brows in an instant thanks to a spectrum of natural shades - and you won't be caught short sans sharpener - just twist. Nobody need ever know that your elegant, face framing arches were quickly drawn on in the back of the taxi!  ",
